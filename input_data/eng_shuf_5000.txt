The issue is that we should know in how many years, five years or ten years, every European will know how to use a computer, whatever their age, and will have Internet access.<EOL>
The so-called development spending of certain governments leaves many questions unanswered, and coordination often leaves something to be desired.<EOL>
How many times following a tragic incident on the motorways of Europe has the accident proven to be due to human error?<EOL>
Lastly, in conclusion, I would like to remind you that, as with the fires in Greece in 2007, this violent storm has demonstrated the need for a civil protection force that can be mobilised in all crisis areas.<EOL>
Please just think about Chernobyl.<EOL>
However, I would also thank her for tabling some proposals here in plenary which are in keeping with the spirit of the Environment Committee's opinion, so that we can have the chance of voting on them.<EOL>
The introduction of tax credits for solar, wind and water power might also send a clear signal to industry when it is investing in energy, thereby facilitating the transition to renewable energy sources.<EOL>
I decided to vote against the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report, although I am a convinced European and I care about the future of the European Union.<EOL>
It seems ludicrous.<EOL>
It cannot work like that.<EOL>
The truth is that I feel frustrated that our hopes and efforts have not been accompanied by efficiency on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme.<EOL>
Nigeria must be induced to surrender Charles Taylor to the court in Sierra Leone, thus doing the right thing by the innumerable victims and survivors in Liberia and elsewhere, and bringing peace to West Africa.<EOL>
There is a quasi-religious belief in the infinite benefits of immigration.<EOL>
That is of the essence if we want to offer more maritime safety to our coastal communities.<EOL>
It is up to the Commission now to take action.<EOL>
It must also be noted that the general concept of agricultural activity has been very broadly defined.<EOL>
I would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur' s overall strategy.<EOL>
That is apparently your opinion, and I should like to stress that it is one that I do not share.<EOL>
The glut of applications, and the fact that only 13% of all projects in respect of which applications were submitted could be funded, makes it apparent that significantly greater sums need to be made available.<EOL>
I am not opposed to either economic liberalisation or liberalisation of the regulations, but I do not consider the intention of the directive to be present in the proposal now being tabled.<EOL>
(PL) Mr President, at the Lima Summit pro-abortion amendments to the resolution on poverty and social exclusion were tabled by a Member of the European Parliament.<EOL>
Firstly, there is the flexible approach to setting a ceiling on amounts to be received from EU funds, as advocated by the European Parliament in its resolution.<EOL>
The Commission's communication on establishing a strategy on protecting the rights of children was very welcome.<EOL>
   – Madam President, Mr Mitchell, I think that that is a good idea in principle, as I, too, believe that we must together fight to ensure that racism and xenophobia in Europe do not stand a chance.<EOL>
We find ourselves in a genuine emergency situation, whether we like it or not, and therefore we must find the strength and courage to support measures which, in order to protect a higher collective good like people’s security, may exceptionally and temporarily, and at all times subject to authorisation from the competent judicial authorities, also restrict individual rights.<EOL>
in writing. - (FI) Tomorrow we will see that many parts of Europe still have the political will to maintain their vitally important monopoly on gambling, and that is true of Finland as well.<EOL>
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, I have to be honest with you - I have one specific problem with the entire Dayton Agreement, and it is that one of the parties to it is Mr Milosevic.<EOL>
It is true that the Bank is also asked to support the general policies of the Community, but this must be done without undermining the aim of stability.<EOL>
His argument was that it was paid to all pensioners living in Britain, regardless of means, regardless of how cold or warm it was in the part of Britain they lived in.<EOL>
On the other hand, alternative non-traditional product chains must also be developed.<EOL>
They have borne the burden of the actual implementation and, in my view, they are therefore the heroes of the conversion.<EOL>
Humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this.<EOL>
   Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, here we are, reacting with astonishment to something that is actually self-explanatory: an election being won by a party that gave people the feeling that it cared about them, while the others could be written off as a crew of corrupt crooks.<EOL>
Will unilateral market thinking at European global level persist or will fair competition and solidarity prevail, and will we Europeans prove to Africa that the Millennium Objectives are achievable after all?<EOL>
The cost to the Community budget would be almost nothing and statistical secrecy would be guaranteed through the data being incorporated.<EOL>
What is more, I also believe we have the obligation to present such a motion.<EOL>
Croatia remains one of the main trafficking routes for drugs to the EU.<EOL>
<EOL>
Such mechanisms violate human rights and run counter to the basic principles of free and pluralistic social organisation.<EOL>
We also addressed you on the matter, Mr Commissioner in the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy.<EOL>
Seas and oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface and contain 90% of the biosphere.<EOL>
The European Council expressed the wish that the Commission present a Community action programme as a counterpart to the national programmes.<EOL>
On the other hand, it is obvious that the option to use either of the two methods offers the advantage of a speedier adaptation on the part of those who choose one or other of the systems.<EOL>
In the case of sudden, heavy rainfall, floods can cause even more damage, because of the infrastructure problems in these regions.<EOL>
There are the movements of the global market, there is the policy of the United States, and we are looking on.<EOL>
As well as the deficit, the level of public debt must be analysed and best practices regarding this issue adopted, in such a way as to make a more stable situation possible and to prevent the recurrence of the same errors in the future.<EOL>
It is also important that these improvements in the transposition of European legislation be implemented much more emphatically in the procurement rules, that there be improvements in the powers to overcome obstacles and in enforcement, particularly in the Member States.<EOL>
We previously rejected this kind of broad investment programme, firstly because there is no money and, secondly, because it does not work at European level.<EOL>
<EOL>
The next item is the report (A5-0186/2001) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the petitions declared admissible concerning silicone implants (Petitions Nos 470/98 and 771/98) [2001/2068(INI)]<EOL>
I would prefer to see a strengthening there.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
So please make sure they have their voices heard from the beginning next time.<EOL>
As I have already said, the idea of circular migration is intended precisely for this purpose: to avoid sapping energy on a permanent basis.<EOL>
There may be a graduation of fines, but these do not seem to deter them. They still do it.<EOL>
I commend the report to the House.<EOL>
<EOL>
If one or two Member States reject the drafts, a unanimous solution will have to be found in respect of the agreed playing rules for treaty changes.<EOL>
Not only does the key word 'solidarity' not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other.<EOL>
It is worth recalling that the Parliament is actually the only elected Community Institution, directly appointed by the citizens to whom it is accountable and whom it must inform daily of the Board's forthcoming activities.<EOL>
Air traffic has increased considerably and we must treat safety issues with particular attention.<EOL>
We will produce a communication, which will undoubtedly be supported, enhanced and improved by Parliament's contributions: a communication on services of general interest and public services.<EOL>
The greatest potential for reduction is in the realisation of the Single European Sky, which means that it depends on the political will of the Member States.<EOL>
European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters (<EOL>
Mr Prodi said: ‘We are going to die for the budget’.<EOL>
Because the politicians of Europe have failed to do so.<EOL>
This task has been rendered easier through a database created by the Commission which lists the different performances defined in eco-labels that can be used in connection with award procedures.<EOL>
It is encouraging to see that the main democratic opposition movement, the National Council of Resistance, is led by a woman like Mrs Maryam Rajavi.<EOL>
The Council meeting of 20 September, and then the European Council that met the following day, decided, as you know, on rapid implementation of the Action Plan against terrorism, with a December deadline for each of the three decisions that we are discussing today, which are key elements of this action plan.<EOL>
I trust that it is the last one, Mrs Theato.<EOL>
(RO) We live on a planet with a diverse climate.<EOL>
Parliament - this rapporteur, in any case - is behind him.<EOL>
Even if the take-over of power by the military occurred without great protests from the population, there is no alternative to a properly functioning democracy brought about by free elections.<EOL>
In those countries that have reformed their labour markets, we see better development in terms of employment; and in those countries whose taxes make matters easier for business, we see more enterprise.<EOL>
All of this is done in the name of the neoliberal Lisbon Agenda.<EOL>
My country's government has therefore refrained from signing the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly as there was a serious risk that the ratification process in Poland would effectively be blocked if a different decision were to be taken.<EOL>
In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy.<EOL>
Maltese citizens are now also part of this much wider project that will increase benefits for all of Europe.<EOL>
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.<EOL>
I have therefore been very encouraged by what you said, and by the details of the initiatives and actions you mentioned that are aimed at finding a solution at the earliest opportunity. In addition, I am in favour of setting up a compensation fund to assist companies affected by the sanctions.<EOL>
This report is moving in this direction, which is why I have voted in favour of it.<EOL>
If, however, we are taking sustainable agriculture seriously, we must take a step forwards here.<EOL>
It is important, however, that the issue should be raised once again: the world and our society are changing all the time, and political decisions must stand up to present-day scrutiny.<EOL>
The budget is the hub where all the spokes of the European wheel come together.<EOL>
Protection of the environment through criminal law (debate)<EOL>
However, I must tell you that there are new ideas as regards the application of the new strategy on health and safety and, to reply to your concern as to whether further steps will be taken, thought is being given to applying the open cooperation method to the field of health and safety, which means common objectives, common national action plans, recommendations and cooperation between Member States.<EOL>
At the same time, we expect the Commission to vigorously support these amendments, which express the continued will of the House, in the talks with the Council at second reading.<EOL>
In the end, it is the two sides who come together to make the decision and to find the peace.<EOL>
It also fails to call into question the liberalisation of the sector in 2009, promoting instead the opening up of the sector and the primacy of competition in this regard.<EOL>
The advance of technology and the development of satellite systems must be notable for the widest possible cooperation aimed at contributing to the improvement and upgrading of the standard of living of the citizen and at a human centred conception of progress.<EOL>
This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EU’s revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities.<EOL>
It is only because of its provisional nature – it will expire in December 2006 – that we can accept the insertion of a provision setting out that: ‘Exceptionally, in applying Rule 117, account shall be taken, with regard to the official languages of the countries which will accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004, as of that date and until 31 December 2006, of the availability in real terms and sufficient numbers of the requisite interpreters and translators’.<EOL>
Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece.<EOL>
Secondly, access to international markets.<EOL>
This is an area in which I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being so frank in what he said.<EOL>
In one of your letters from prison, you addressed an Israeli friend and poet, Ya' ir Horowitz, who had recently died. In your letter, you tried to re-establish a dialogue that had been interrupted by death, outlining the dream of peace that you shared and drawing on the resources of hope to fight the despair which threatened to overwhelm you because the dream of peace was fading with time.<EOL>
That is the reason why we cannot vote for this second proposal.<EOL>
I would like to point out, on the basis of my own almost three years of experience, that even in this House, the majorities are not always in favour of sustainable development and sustainable solutions.<EOL>
This is also a matter included in the Presidency's programme, where it talks about common interests.<EOL>
As far as the children are concerned, of course they want a happy mother who is not afraid that she will lose her job and who is not afraid that she will not be able to feed them or bring them up.<EOL>
Hence, discussions on food prices ought to address not only rational farmland use and exploring alternative energy sources.<EOL>
And he added unashamedly that Council ended by approving this Protocol.<EOL>
Yet, threaded throughout the text we find evidence of the ongoing urge to persecute drivers.<EOL>
Mr President, I would say this to the Commissioner: If you will forgive the pun, the milk crisis is something the Commission has made a pig's ear of, a saying we have in Ireland when somebody has made a complete hash of something.<EOL>
That is available in our statistics.<EOL>
Mr President, may I also add to the growing numbers of tributes that were paid to you earlier on.<EOL>
Ten countries will be able to join the EU from 2004, two countries from 2007, and Turkey will probably be given a date for its next meeting.<EOL>
I believe we must now, with the help of an extremely open strategy, learn how to deal with this and perhaps also to convey the message that both the European Commission and the European Parliament are capable of formulating very good and very firm positions.<EOL>
The outcome of the independent technical feasibility study next year, for which the European Commission recently issued an invitation to tender, will be important.<EOL>
Its main advocate is the Commission, which wants to drive through this legislation at any price.<EOL>
We are uneasy because we do not understand very well where this High Level Working Group comes from or why it is being maintained, why the Council is making a proposal in this way and why that proposal was taken up at Tampere; what the Commission is going to do in these action plans and what coherence there is between this proposal and the work carried out by the Council' s High Level Working Group and the rest of the Commission proposals on policies to be implemented in the Union.<EOL>
What happened there is dreadful.<EOL>
Everyone knows that a citizens' Europe cannot be built upon forms of discrimination that give rise to injustice and exclusion and that engender racism.<EOL>
That concludes the debate.<EOL>
The Commission came up with its proposal on energy and climate change a few weeks ago.<EOL>
I agree with the opinion presented in the resolution that the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the electoral process is an indispensable element aimed at preventing the Kosovo Serbian community from being marginalised.<EOL>
As you will remember, in the Water Framework Directive, the main legislative instrument for EU policy on the protection of water, allowance was made for further legislation being necessary on two issues: EU quality standards for groundwater and EU quality standards for priority substances in surface water.<EOL>
Some fifteen years ago, I launched a campaign in Belgium under the title "Sex colleague, ex-colleague" .<EOL>
There is nonetheless some quite sharp criticism, and I am very glad about that.<EOL>
Petitions: see Minutes<EOL>
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the rise of extremism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia in Europe.<EOL>
It is quite obvious that China is miles away from any kind of suitability as an Olympic host.<EOL>
I do not think we would be able vote in favour had it not done so, and another reason why I see this as important is that it would not merely leave it to the market to develop a single European system of provision for financial liability; instead, from the very outset, one would be given shape and guided in a proper direction.<EOL>
I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair compromise: vodka - only from grain, potatoes and sugar beets.<EOL>
The distribution of researchers by main fields of science shows different patterns for men and women.<EOL>
The Commission therefore gives much consideration to these links.<EOL>
And that is not the last we have heard of it, for if I understand it correctly, the United States wants to adopt the same line for agricultural products too.<EOL>
It is also an important framework to guard against political misconduct in day-to-day politics and it is also an important framework for a proactive financial, budgetary and economic policy debate in our Member States.<EOL>
People must continue to take responsibility for whether or not they expose themselves to natural radiation.<EOL>
It is a text which we will respect and implement when a title for waiver of the Helms-Burton Act is granted.<EOL>
That is inadmissible in any Parliament.<EOL>
The programmes for which financing is approved must be adequately supported by the political authority - the Council and Parliament - and technically supported by the executive authority, which is the Commission.<EOL>
Hence, the Stability Pact and hence, in Maastricht in its time, today Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union forbids deficits or the granting of credit to cover those deficits by the European Central Bank and the central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro.<EOL>
And who takes the decision not to accept these proposals?<EOL>
The time for hesitation is past.<EOL>
in writing. - (NL) What is this Parliament meddling in now?<EOL>
But very much depends on decisions this week.<EOL>
Recently, on 1 November, there was dreadful violence and repression in Ethiopia and all opposition leaders were arrested.<EOL>
These funds are aimed at supporting the Qimonda workers who have been made redundant, through the recognition of skills, professional training, training and support with a view to setting up businesses, assistance in self-placement and incentives for recruitment and professional practice gained in the workplace.<EOL>
It is necessary to maintain a balance and I am proud of the work we are doing in this field.<EOL>
I can give you some data on that, if you wish.<EOL>
You have tabled no less than eight sets of draft resolutions and oral questions reflecting, in my view, the strength of parliamentary involvement and opinion on EPAs.<EOL>
The resolution also tries to deal with the more sensitive issue of involvement by Western, and specifically US and European, technology and companies in providing the capacity for certain governments to censor and filter Internet material.<EOL>
The Member States should be allowed to act on their own responsibility by imposing deterrent charges.<EOL>
The Commission should ensure that there are no inconsistencies and should require that a reduction in deficit be registered before doing so.<EOL>
The extended neighbourhood policies will be a valuable tool for applying such an engagement in real terms.<EOL>
It is important to remain strictly impartial and objective on this issue, resisting the temptation to approach it bombastically.<EOL>
Will he conceal his money or his assets, perhaps at an even later hour than our debate this evening?<EOL>
That, at least, is the impression you gave in the election campaign in Sweden.<EOL>
The Commission is working closely with the ILO on the preparations for the meeting which will offer us, in particular, an opportunity to promote decent work worldwide on behalf of the European Union.<EOL>
The EU Veterinary Committee will have its next meeting on 20 March, at which time the situation in the UK and France will be discussed again, along with possible future measures.<EOL>
Over the centuries, Romania has been under various influences - Byzantine, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman.<EOL>
I am therefore against public health programmes which can be used as leverage to influence national policy, whilst the programmes currently before us hardly represent any added value compared to Member State efforts.<EOL>
But in the end this all happened only because of the massive pressure from Parliament and an indignant public, and unfortunately it happened far too late!<EOL>
Only six of them agreed to leave - six out of 3 400 people!<EOL>
We have a conflict and that relates to the question of how much money there should be in the near future for MEPs' assistants.<EOL>
The Union itself was to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.<EOL>
Turning to information exchange, this can be pro-competitive when it enables companies to gather general market data that allow them to serve customers better.<EOL>
Finally, and because sometimes the devil is in the detail, our task is to ensure, even in the more technical areas, that the legislation we produce always offers the best means of protection for our citizens.<EOL>
Why do we send intervention forces to combat ethnic cleansing for certain peoples and do nothing to protect the Palestinian people?<EOL>
We discussed the challenges facing the sector in the years ahead, especially with the final abolition of quotas on 1 January 2005, which is also the proposed date for the conclusion of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations.<EOL>
Mr President, it would be wiser to answer this question in writing.<EOL>
We believe that this really is a poor assessment.<EOL>
We have seen it in the Wild West in the United States.<EOL>
One emphasis of this year's International Women's Day on 8 March will be to draw attention to the glaring violation of women's rights in Afghanistan and exert international pressure on the government in Kabul.<EOL>
In practical terms, I believe it must be possible to develop these actions in two directions.<EOL>
In consideration of this, we are proposing the creation of a European intelligence school.<EOL>
The prospectus directive is designed to establish the ground rules under which an issuer of shares, bonds or other securities may access investors throughout the 15 Member States.<EOL>
We must be realistic, however.<EOL>
If there is a struggle between the conservatives on the one hand and the reformers on the other, then I am convinced that it is the task of Parliament to support the reformers.<EOL>
Perhaps now that you have seen the results I could ask political groups to withdraw their requests for roll-call votes.<EOL>
I hope that it will be swiftly implemented, and for that reason it would be wise if this Parliament showed moderation in the number of projects.<EOL>
Consequently, on 3 April this year the Commission adopted a Recommendation on better cooperation in order to remedy the shortcomings in the implementation, application and enforcement of the existing Directive.<EOL>
I would also cite the transformation of the Trusteeship Council into a Council for Failed States.<EOL>
This new legislation is based on the fundamental need to guarantee food safety from farm to table, along the lines of the initiatives that have been adopted over the past months in order to provide the consumer with the best possible guarantees.<EOL>
The next item is the joint debate on the reports:<EOL>
They would both make an important contribution, not only to the recovery efforts, but crucially to the long-term effectiveness of financial supervision and the strength of the EU financial sector.<EOL>
The origins of the current situation lie primarily in the massive increase in international aviation, accompanied by strong competition between aviation companies, since the early 1990s.<EOL>
However, the regulatory framework has also encountered problems, owing to its slow implementation in many Member States.<EOL>
I am thinking, in particular, of what Mr Ullman said concerning the Commission's attitude.<EOL>
It means equivalent safety standards will apply to all facilities.<EOL>
I understand that, in the Netherlands, the idea of the autonomy of the individual, who must take central stage, is very important.<EOL>
We also expect the Commission’s legislative proposal to contain explicit proposals on how to prevent what is termed ‘triangular trade’ being carried on through the least-developed countries.<EOL>
   . I will be voting in favour of the report despite reservations.<EOL>
I am among those who find it regrettable that these messages have not been listened to properly, but the Council's gamble in June was to make use of the upgrading of bilateral relations to send the messages with greater force, at a higher level, and to a greater variety of contacts.<EOL>
What happened to the debates that were announced?<EOL>
That is why, after some very difficult debates, after – I can assure you – some highly sensitive negotiations within my group, we have taken the line that you have heard on various occasions and that I will make my own.<EOL>
This is why we need an annual report on this issue.<EOL>
Now we all know that the restructuring of the coal and steel industries has not yet been completed, that these sectors continue to lose jobs, and will possibly do so at an even greater rate in the future.<EOL>
I am convinced that most people, on reflection, would rather see a parliament working positively for change than one which allowed anger and irritation to gain the upper hand.<EOL>
We must stop financing this war, which is a bloody, colonial war for oil and an especially bloody form of electoral campaigning.<EOL>
The key idea is that employment is the best safeguard against social exclusion and poverty.<EOL>
I think this has completely lost all sense of proportion.<EOL>
We wish to increase the Court of Auditors' access to information from the European Investment Bank.<EOL>
Under this agreement the Treaty principles are maintained.<EOL>
   Madam President, it is rare for a draft directive to incite such passions.<EOL>
If they do not, we will take this up with them within ICCAT and bilaterally.<EOL>
In this area we must respond to public opinion.<EOL>
The Europe 2020 strategy is consensual, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable.<EOL>
It will not attract price-conscious customers in the countries of the old Fifteen either.<EOL>
Also, we do not support the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality.<EOL>
I am sure it gives you much less pleasure than it gives us.<EOL>
The Liberal Party' s five Members of the European Parliament support the efforts in this report to give better diplomatic training to those EC officials who work in the Commission' s delegations.<EOL>
My group, which approves the proposal of the European Forum of Migrants, for a deontological code for the media, highlights in an amendment the essential role that the media should play in denouncing racism and promoting tolerance, showing particularly the positive contribution which immigrants have made and still make to European society.<EOL>
A critical view should however be taken with regard to an issue which is given much space in the communication, namely that of placing greater emphasis on the Commission’s recommendations on economic development.<EOL>
The peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic and religious groups present in Iraq can be brought about through a renewal of the institutions, with the implementation of a federal formula - federalism - which allows broad autonomy for the various regions within the framework of a unitary State.<EOL>
Tibet has never been part of China on a permanent basis.<EOL>
I think this is extremely important and I therefore think we should pursue this idea.<EOL>
It is right, therefore, to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America.<EOL>
We believe in striking the golden mean in this case.<EOL>
With moves to open up banking across borders, how does the European Commission intend to protect its citizens/consumers, given the experience with Equitable Life?<EOL>
But if we can agree on regional aid, we should decide whether to change the extent of such aid.<EOL>
Food security is a fundamental right that is impeded by limited natural resources, high energy prices and climate change.<EOL>
I would love to let you, but I cannot give you the floor.<EOL>
One of these, which once symbolised the Soviet Union, is with great difficulty becoming a thing of the past.<EOL>
On the question of responsibility, I agree with Mrs Kauppi on the fact that there has effectively been a great deal of resistance in the Council, but it is clear that the Commission - yourself in particular - has never been a fan, to put it mildly, of more regulation at European level.<EOL>
For this reason I have two suggestions to make.<EOL>
It has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people inside Sudan, over 200 000 people into neighbouring Chad and the number of civilian deaths has risen to almost 50 000.<EOL>
We are thinking in the long term when we think of Chile.<EOL>
The consumer in the supermarket should not only have a quality guarantee but should also be able to identify exactly where the meat has come from.<EOL>
Mr President, the very first thing I would like to do is thank the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, very much indeed for this report on the Commission 's fifth supplementary and amending budget, and make it known that it meets with our approval.<EOL>
But I would ask the Conference of Presidents, in the interests of fair and balanced reporting, to issue an invitation to the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister of Israel, so that we can hear the other side of the story.<EOL>
And if they have eased sufficiently, what sort of timescale are you talking about for the necessary reforms to be implemented in full so that the full negotiation process can get back on track?<EOL>
We are concerned to note that staff would be subject to non-renewable statutes.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur has said, this document examines two Commission proposals: the first concerns the establishment of the single committee, to be known as the Committee on Safe Seas, and the second concerns a directive which amends the existing directives in order to incorporate the committee.<EOL>
The internal market must therefore function fully in all its aspects and this is, of course, the task that President Barroso has entrusted me with, under your control.<EOL>
By the end of June, we are expecting a new Managing Director to have been appointed for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has, as we all know, been accused of a very serious crime that, unfortunately, has probably also damaged the reputation of the IMF.<EOL>
Oral questions and written declarations (submission): see Minutes<EOL>
I shall stress especially the European Digital Agenda, which is an important part of the Europe 2020 strategy.<EOL>
Can the Commissioner promise that this is not the case and that this directive also relates to minority languages?<EOL>
However, in both cases the provisions are important and must be adopted under the same conditions as the main text itself.<EOL>
Indeed it is in the Council, most often, where there are obstacles.<EOL>
As I see it, where the EU needs to change is in the clarity of its rhetoric.<EOL>
At the same time, however, by integrating Cyprus, the European Union itself is demonstrating that it is an international entity with international credentials and this will help enormously in resolving the Cyprus problem.<EOL>
The second objective relates to CO2 emissions.<EOL>
If this amendment should get through it would represent a setback for democracy.<EOL>
This is simply not true.<EOL>
These principles must be rooted in a new realisation of the worth of a woman as wife, mother, carer or employee, as a human being and a person who is the equal of a man, despite being different.<EOL>
The problem is that it is not being properly implemented across all Member States and we must be even more vigilant in making sure that we are monitoring it properly.<EOL>
We hope that the evaluations will follow promptly and believe that the market will eventually determine the European Statute a few years following those evaluations.<EOL>
Another sticking point with the PPE-DE Group, ladies and gentlemen, is the decision of the Committee on the Environment to extend the scope of the regulation from pesticide sales and use to pesticide production, import, export and distribution.<EOL>
For that reason, if the quotas need to be retained, then the size of these quotas must be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity.<EOL>
Colombia, as a country, is a hostage to terrorism, more than any other, and Ingrid Betancourt must be released, and all the other hostages must be released as well.<EOL>
Indeed, by a happy coincidence, the designs for the future euro banknotes were presented at this same Council, giving a recognizable face to Europe's currency, and demonstrating the very tangible nature of this project of ours, which concerns every European and is a tool in the struggle for jobs.<EOL>
I should like to add that any future enlargement must be preceded by fundamental reform of the financial perspectives, and by an appropriate increase in the Union's budget.<EOL>
If we want a well-balanced, informative media environment, we must support independent public broadcasters as the counterparts of private broadcasters.<EOL>
Finally, I could not finish without telling you how pleased I am to see that today the Commission is going to table its proposal on the European Institute for Gender Equality, as it was invited to do by the European Council in June 2004.<EOL>
The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.<EOL>
It would be tragic if there was a re-occurrence of what happened last time, when there was a delay of seven months.<EOL>
The Slovenian Presidency has set the accession negotiations with Turkey as one of its primary objectives, and we hope that this goal will be achieved, so that we can open additional negotiation chapters in the near future.<EOL>
Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the case that that decade gave rise to hopes and aspirations, and that much was done to achieve the objectives that had been set, particularly in the area of employment.<EOL>
The Commission has submitted a proposal concerning the establishment of the Agency headquarters in Pristina.<EOL>
The universities must also be guardians and must be committed to quality and be the main protagonists and conveyors of the culture of hard work and open and transparent evaluation.<EOL>
It is now time that the EU and its Member States raise the tempo and support increased funding for innovation and technology.<EOL>
The Commission is also prepared to examine funding for the Truth and Reconciliation Committee being set up under its budget line for human rights and democracy.<EOL>
However, the Minutes state that, in response to both Questions Nos 46 and 51, Mrs Thors was allowed to ask two supplementary questions.<EOL>
I hope that this is not an accurate calculation.<EOL>
This is precisely for the purpose of making it clear that this is a humanitarian operation, but I also think it is a good thing that the population and political circles in Serbia see that the world outside is also prepared to help in this way.<EOL>
Not so long ago, the importance of the Lisbon process was discussed once again during the Summit in Brussels.<EOL>
If that proves to be the case, top priority should be given to setting up a common European prosecution service.<EOL>
I would like to hear rather more of that.<EOL>
As Commissioner Malmström has assured us, profiling will not be possible through automatic processing of the data supplied.<EOL>
A sector constrained by a series of outdated, contradictory and often incomprehensible rules can only have very limited responsibility in this state of things, and yet it alone has to pay the price.<EOL>
I think that a general European regulation, as proposed by our rapporteur, should, on account of its general application, ensure that unilateral measures with often unfortunate consequences are avoided in future.<EOL>
My group therefore supports the call made at the recent summit of Latin American nations for discussions to be held with a view to establishing minimum rules of conduct where major flows within the financial and economic worlds are concerned.<EOL>
At the moment, it is important that each state adopts this measure, as otherwise there is the risk of causing panic among the population.<EOL>
So in this case, it is not Great Britain, it is in fact France which is entirely responsible and the least we can do is to say so clearly in our resolution.<EOL>
I would like particularly to invite Mr Byrne to confirm to the House that the provisions of last week's Communication by President Prodi on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment will be applied in full to the extension of his proposal.<EOL>
It is therefore necessary to pay particular attention to fishing in this region, because fishing in the Mediterranean has more specificities than elsewhere and it should be subject to specific measures.<EOL>
We want a strong UN, we want security and stability, we want an incisive war on poverty, and we want effective protection of human rights.<EOL>
The fact is that the relationship between Europe and the United States is the most important relationship that exists on this planet.<EOL>
The proposal of EUR 30 that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development approved will, therefore, resolve this discrimination.<EOL>
They participated, for the first time, in political decisions that will affect their own, and their country’s, future.<EOL>
Then the victim should be able to call upon this compensation body in his own country.<EOL>
And, in any event, there is not the slightest sign on the horizon of any alternative possibility of negotiation on the Palestinian side.<EOL>
I would therefore like to ask you, to the extent possible during your Presidency, to speed up the use of the means at your disposal, because otherwise I think it will be too late.<EOL>
It is not that they are not there.<EOL>
   – Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your full and informative reply.<EOL>
Only Kuwait extended the vote to men and not to women.<EOL>
Is there any way today of reversing what has happened, namely the rigging of elections?<EOL>
I am amazed at how many people have an interest in this.<EOL>
It is unfortunate that in this procedure it is a rule rather than an exception that we have to keep asking for the same things over and over again - not only such things as electronic signatures or for red tape in this House to be reduced, but also matters of importance such as the question of to whom we actually grant discharge.<EOL>
My political party, for example, a big political party in that country, is routinely and openly discriminated against and boycotted by the Flemish public service broadcaster, and on the basis of official directives to boot.<EOL>
   – Mr President, thank you very much for your consideration; great things are currently going on in my group, and so we had to be there.<EOL>
The issues that this raises are the objectivity of the Commission's legislative proposals and whether or not the Commission is truly independent of industrial interests.<EOL>
I have put forward three amendments myself: two involve minor corrections and the third is to restate the European Parliament's position, calling for the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to become legally binding.<EOL>
Can that be funded?<EOL>
We have fully and unconditionally condemned this attack and have offered our condolences to the relatives of the victims, the Russian Government and the Russian people.<EOL>
She is without doubt responsible for the fact that, in recent years, there has been a series of actions aiming to overcome violence against women.<EOL>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)<EOL>
The objective is to give ECHO the opportunity to define a meaningful exit strategy in connection with different crises.<EOL>
(CS) Mr President-in-Office, at this point, I would like to express my opinion on the unbundling of production and transmission systems for gas in connection with the adopted legislation.<EOL>
I am of the firm conviction that, given the colonial history of these countries, Europe has a major obligation to this region.<EOL>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all the key question of this debate today is what we can expect from this European Council on Thursday and on Friday.<EOL>
Equally, the Member States must involve local employment agencies in the processes of decentralising the European Employment Strategy, given the physical proximity of these bodies and their better knowledge of the situations of the local labour markets.<EOL>
In that respect, the signing of EU readmission agreements represents a real challenge.<EOL>
As a matter of fact, in its latest report, covering the year 2000, the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia notes that a substantial rise in the level of racial violence and in the incidence of anti-Semitic attacks and racially motivated threats and intimidation was recorded in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.<EOL>
We also need a broad programme of legislative intervention and special projects to make the most of and to protect the natural beauty and cultural wealth of our islands, the refurbishment of traditional housing, the protection of the sea, the management of water, sewage and wastes, and the creation of conditions leading to democratic recovery and steady development.<EOL>
Mr Moreira Da Silva's Report points in the right direction, and does so excellently.<EOL>
All this is positive and is acknowledged in the report.<EOL>
Our situation with regard to property is an unnatural one.<EOL>
Amending budget No 1/2008 (<EOL>
We must remember that road hauliers are not, in the main, vast enterprises, but small businesses with a handful of vehicles.<EOL>
We do not need more aid organisations but should, rather, endeavour to pool our common efforts within already existing organisations.<EOL>
My opinion contains a proposal for the wording of such a clause.<EOL>
Furthermore, the Council even complied with Parliament' s request to delete all references to EU origin.<EOL>
The European Court of Justice has previously condemned Italy, France and Germany for allowing the hunting of wildlife species during their migratory period.<EOL>
For what kind of things do you actually want more information, however?<EOL>
We have difficulty in accepting the remaining Amendments, that is to say Amendment No 1, Amendment No 3, part 2, Amendment No 4, part 1 and Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 which neither improve nor clarify the text.<EOL>
It is important that we are debating it here in Parliament.<EOL>
It is not a marginal issue that only affects a few of us, but a new commitment that the Union needs to adopt as one of the new Millennium goals, and we have already clearly spelt out what that means.<EOL>
Why am I saying this, Mr President?<EOL>
We must provide more financial resources for programmes that provide foreign experience and possibly the exchange of students.<EOL>
It is the responsibility of Member States to initiate action if they have evidence of harm due to the consumption of a particular foodstuff.<EOL>
Such misconceptions have sadly changed very little since the Dark Ages' comprehension of the physical world.<EOL>
When the discussion turns to setting up a fund, providing debt relief etc., one must also remember to talk about 'additional money' so that we leave behind the situation in which it is the same money that circulates through the system and is never paid out.<EOL>
That is the mission for us, as politicians.<EOL>
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.<EOL>
It is our task as Members, as representatives of the people, to take our electors' and our citizens' interests seriously and to defend them.<EOL>
In fact the Ecolabel is more than just a mark of environmental quality: through ongoing upward adjustment of product environmental excellence requirements, the Ecolabel will become an incentive for continuous improvement and innovation.<EOL>
It is a report which will enable us to become directly involved in the spheres of activity of the European Union and to implement the measures it contains.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law.<EOL>
As rapporteur, I therefore feel that the Commission has judged the matter correctly in terms of the economy, but that a number of points should have been added.<EOL>
Finally, Mr President, convergence is not an aim in itself.<EOL>
   Mr President, Mr Prodi, over the past five years your relations with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been through good times and difficult times, as is normal, but allow me to say that, in the light of these weeks’ hearings, I am sure – or rather, I should say I fear – that many of us are going to miss your Commission, particularly some of its members, and this is certainly not good news for Europe or for us.<EOL>
Many are living in fear, particularly of losing their jobs, and are looking to the EU to save them.<EOL>
<EOL>
Semantic gobbledy-gook is of no interest to Parliament.<EOL>
   Mr President, eyes have understandably been on the slaughter in Lebanon.<EOL>
Emissions of greenhouse gases from the production of tar sand are 3-5 times greater than from conventional production of oil and natural gas.<EOL>
It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses.<EOL>
I call on you, Members of the Council, to see Europe as it really is.<EOL>
It is a lesson for us in the future that, as politicians and parliamentarians, we should focus on simplification and minimum regulation.<EOL>
We believe that a critical dialogue with the governments of these countries is the best approach – and that this engagement can and does bring some results.<EOL>
In some cases, the fuel shortage has claimed human lives.<EOL>
We therefore need the common reference framework, because we need uniform standards in order to build consumer confidence.<EOL>
For this reason, I strongly contest that the adoption of Amendment No 14 should cause the other two, including our Amendment No 18, to lapse.<EOL>
Access must be improved for local and regional public authorities to obtain funding for investments in projects for renewable energy resources and energy efficiency.<EOL>
Is there a proposal to set up a coordination unit that will be permanently operable at some central point to help coordinate these cross-border natural disasters that have an impact right across the Union?<EOL>
It is far more challenging and hostile than the North Sea and to me, it is a conundrum.<EOL>
I hope that the Council, like Parliament, will support our proposals.<EOL>
Each time, Europe's policy is a Malthusian policy, even as far as the most technical points are concerned, such as the budgetary stability pact, which is actually a budgetary rationing pact.<EOL>
It is the quintessence of the dynamic equilibrium between the various forms of life and the various ecosystems.<EOL>
As everybody here needs to recognise, there are major limitations in relation to resources that will be available as a result of enlargement and there are implications for the financial perspective in relation to Category 5 expenditure.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could actually greet you all by name, such is the impressive level of attendance.<EOL>
It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities, but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the closer we are to the citizens, the greater our chances of being comprehensible, credible and effective.<EOL>
That is what would potentially break the deadlock on the start of plans for a Community patent.<EOL>
It is our common responsibility to deliver what was promised, what is expected by the beneficiaries, what has been built up, as a budget, on the revenue side, while fully respecting the fiscal sovereignty of Member States.<EOL>
Success by our enterprises will also depend on the increased coordination of budget policies, but also on fiscal policy at the European level, whose purpose is so far as possible to prevent distortions in competition arising from discriminatory fiscal measures.<EOL>
President-in-Office of the Council.<EOL>
We are a little bit between the devil and the deep blue sea, on the one hand between Mr Jonckheer, who says we should make sure this sort of thing does not happen any more and, on the other hand, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Lehne and Lord Inglewood, who say it is impossible to completely avoid criminal fraud.<EOL>
Are there perhaps other variations?<EOL>
We cannot simply oppose options that some consider to be warmongering; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side, in the shape of someone who, in the past, has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future.<EOL>
Finally, this ports directive would be bad for port workers.<EOL>
I would therefore ask him to kindly withdraw the comments he made about me and thank him in advance.<EOL>
That is quite an important question which is, of course, not at all easy to answer one way or another.<EOL>
Normally, provided they have attended the vote we are liberal in the interpretation of the Rule.<EOL>
I believe that we should be honest as between friends, but above all that we should not be cowardly.<EOL>
That is part of the problem that exists.<EOL>
Acts of violence on both sides need to stop in order to make way for transparent dialogue in good faith, putting an end to a conflict which has already caused too many deaths and is still resulting in large numbers of displaced people and refugees.<EOL>
It will not be possible to achieve any promise without calling into question the dominant economic and social models.<EOL>
It has been argued here tonight that this is impossible with regard to some matters, owing for example the imprecise definition of 'documents'.<EOL>
Animals must be slaughtered as close as possible to the place where they have been reared.<EOL>
Such tragedies occur around Europe every day, if not always in such spectacular forms.<EOL>
The current situation, this crisis, has occurred to warn us against a disastrous political decision.<EOL>
Stress during transportation has a direct effect on the quality of meat, as Mrs Hautala stated.<EOL>
You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well.<EOL>
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.<EOL>
It is in the EU's interest and, indeed, it is in Turkey's.<EOL>
Alongside this aid, thought must be given to the mechanisms to be put in place, as well as to the efficient management of the crises linked to exceptional natural events.<EOL>
The Directive itself is difficult and technical, but adopting a political stance will be simpler when we see the effects.<EOL>
Mr President, may I begin by saying that I hope you will continue to address this Chamber in your native tongue, which matches any language in the world for its accomplishment, its diversity and its antiquity.<EOL>
Should we not be making it easier for European police forces to locate European terrorists?<EOL>
In this very comprehensive debate here today, I just want to highlight one problem and that is the issue of multilingualism in Macedonia.<EOL>
I am able broadly to concur with what has just been said by one of the rapporteurs concerning both the quality of this debate and the conclusions that must be drawn from it.<EOL>
As far as the UK is concerned, existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate.<EOL>
   Mr President, in our market-led economy, large, often international, companies set the tone.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
It was going to do so today, after a hunger strike that has lasted 33 days, yet an attempt is being made to prevent us from debating the matter.<EOL>
The Court has not stopped there: it has proclaimed this superiority, not only with regard to previous guidelines but also to subsequent ones, which is more questionable.<EOL>
But secondly, and crucially, it is important to remember that the Barcelona process was formulated in an atmosphere of optimism, in the aftermath of the Oslo agreements.<EOL>
Parliament’s delegation has also achieved acceptance for the requirement that authorisations be amended or abrogated where the criteria for authorisation or for the social security regulations to apply are not complied with in substance.<EOL>
I would like to single out one point from among these questions and requests.<EOL>
Until then, the EU must concentrate on making concrete progress in the CSD on those areas - fresh water and energy - in which the EU has taken the initiative, as well as on the new intergovernmental forum on forests.<EOL>
Let us at least take action to get the wheel turning again, or to adjust the load it is carrying.<EOL>
This report is not intended as an ideological proposal, but as a practical attempt to help find a solution for what really is a global tragedy.<EOL>
It is a unique constitution, under which the ethnic element - ethnic Indians and indigenous Fijians - shares power.<EOL>
In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them.<EOL>
Just as there are many haulage contractors on Europe' s roads, there ought also to be many competing railway companies.<EOL>
If the Konrad Adenauer Foundation or the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, for example, had not been present in a country such as Zimbabwe in recent years, many NGOs and civil society would have been without major partners to support their commitment to human rights, democracy and good governance.<EOL>
promoting the use of liquid biofuels, biogas and geothermal energy;<EOL>
In Sweden, one of the countries with the best functioning eco-labelling, we have two competing systems, which is all to the good of eco-labelling.<EOL>
The risk of internal fraud will be drastically reduced once EU officials know that their activities can be investigated by anyone, and not just by a handful of colleagues from their own institutions.<EOL>
I shall simply give the example of the country the Commissioner knows best.<EOL>
Perhaps this could also happen in the case of EU Member States such as Cyprus.<EOL>
Promises to increase energy efficiency have multiplied, but the European Union runs the risk of not meeting the targets that have been proposed: achieving 20% by 2020.<EOL>
We have been together in this House since 1979, and a great deal of trust has grown in that time.<EOL>
Against this background, the Council nevertheless expresses the hope that the transition process in Zaire will take place peacefully.<EOL>
This report closely follows the proposal for a directive presented by Commissioner António Vitorino, which aims at combating the smuggling of immigrants and the trafficking in human beings, without making a clear distinction between the two types of trafficking, which are very different.<EOL>
I am referring to point 5, which is a crucial point, as I have just said, since it relates to financing and to the level of that financing.<EOL>
However, health or restoration to health is not just a right.<EOL>
The point I really want to make - and I would appeal to my integrationist colleagues in this House, because I do not think you have to be a Eurosceptic to be worried about this - is this: look at what happened in yesterday's debate, when my honourable friend, Mr Heaton-Harris, asked us what we were voting on and nobody in the Chamber was able to name the agency to which we had just voted through supply.<EOL>
The number of refusals of requests for documents has increased.<EOL>
I would add that I will not hesitate to use this tool wherever it is necessary.<EOL>
in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European market seems totally incapable of defending itself against dumping from outside of Europe, I note with great satisfaction the first 'institutional' step towards new legislation and harmonisation of the EU market.<EOL>
Do not think me rude if I take it away from him as soon as I realise that it is not a point of order on problems relating to the Rules of Procedure.<EOL>
I am confident that a satisfactory agreement on the 2010 budget will, once again, be achieved through good cooperation and collaboration between all the institutions, and especially with Parliament.<EOL>
To address acute dangers such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is a need not only for clearly defined and internationally recognised rules, but also the political will to act.<EOL>
What, though, is the situation now, four years after that date?<EOL>
Mr President, I wish first to point out that Europe's initiative fell short of expectations but was, at any rate, decisive. The presence of the multinational force and the contribution made to the OSCE initiative were two crucial factors that ought not to be forgotten.<EOL>
In COM(2004)0196 final, the Commission stated that there was a need to provide information about the EU's ideas and values.<EOL>
The Group of the Party of European Socialists has asked for the Commission statement on the World Trade Organization panel's decision on bananas to be brought forward and taken immediately after the presentation of the budget.<EOL>
In particular, as regards Amendments Nos 9 and 35, the Commission can accept that Member States take measures with a view to achieving a separate collection rate of 6 kg per person per year.<EOL>
The vast majority were technical amendments aimed at aligning the text with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and with the new legislative framework for the marketing of goods.<EOL>
Canada is also part of North America.<EOL>
I see the recognition of the importance of growth and employment alongside stability in the resolutions of the Council, and the incorporation of an employment chapter and a new employment guideline procedure in the Treaty of Amsterdam, as good clear signals that the importance of this overall linkage has been recognized for the management of the Union's affairs as we move into monetary union.<EOL>
When we look at the situation in Bosnia we see that 30 to 40 % of deaths in Bosnia are caused by anti-tank mines.<EOL>
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.<EOL>
On the energy internal market package, we need to reach an agreement to show that institutions are able to deliver in the interests of citizens, consumers and businesses, and here we committed to trying to reach political agreement by June 2008.<EOL>
We can only get the citizens of Europe interested in and build their confidence in the EU institutions, in MEPs and national politicians if we provide complete and honest information.<EOL>
There are certainly problems still to overcome, such as corruption, crime or freedom of the media.<EOL>
I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress.<EOL>
According to the United Nations, deep-water coral reefs are a vulnerable habitat which require special attention.<EOL>
The exemplary attitude on the part of Islamic NGOs and an uncompromising public stance on the statements by the Prime Minister have nevertheless calmed the situation.<EOL>
Let me briefly present to you the main features of the Commission's proposal.<EOL>
We are perfectly happy to face up to this competition once we have an outcome with many, rather than the few, sharing in growing prosperity.<EOL>
Amendment No 8 :<EOL>
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.<EOL>
For history teaches us that the Netherlands' golden years - as the wealthiest nation in the 17th-century world - came from uniting the seven provinces, not dividing them.<EOL>
Bloodshed and the imposition of a state of emergency have swept Armenia off the road to democracy, impeding its relations with the European Union.<EOL>
I would point out, Mr President, that industry in Austria has also made great efforts to keep its emissions as low as possible.<EOL>
The report notes that cohesion policy has helped the poorest regions to close the gap in their economic and social development.<EOL>
Improvements may often be achieved here through a more efficient cost-benefit ratio rather than by embarking on an entirely new project.<EOL>
A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war.<EOL>
I know that there are a lot of interested schools, but the national authorities in many countries have not shown enough enthusiasm about this project, which can be a step forward and which can really then be a positive mark for the European Baccalaureate, so we can have European Schools not only in Brussels but everywhere - in new Member States and old Member States.<EOL>
The principles include the formation of a broadly constituted, multi-ethnic and representative government, in which women too participate.<EOL>
Naturally, I would also like to extend my sympathy to all those who have been so badly affected by this horrific violence.<EOL>
The strict fiscal policy of EMU provides the long term economic base for continuing growth and will prevent the short term political temptation to base decisions on grounds of political popularity.<EOL>
It is, then, an aspiration, an attempt at founding an embryonic culture.<EOL>
Secondly, a similar level of services should be offered to EU citizens when checking in at any airport and the same should apply to the service culture and to flights to locations outside the EU.<EOL>
Vote<EOL>
In conclusion, we need reform.<EOL>
I think we should have a rule that we should know at least two hours in advance who will take the floor in the one-minute speeches.<EOL>
Mr President, last night I was privileged to attend the inauguration of the Brussels offices of the European Friends of Israel, which starts from the premise that we should support the democratic State of Israel's right to exist and prosper.<EOL>
That is the critical yardstick of Turkish progress towards the European Union.<EOL>
Regarding the Committee on Petitions and creating publicity about it, the last time this was done was when I was president of that committee.<EOL>
Secondly, there is no definition of a European family, nor do we need one.<EOL>
So I want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Budgets.<EOL>
In brief, the report shows no trace of understanding of prudent budgetary management, in light of the enormous economic problems facing European economies. 'Cut your coat according to your cloth' is a better suggestion than this undesirable call for more and new resources.<EOL>
Does the Council of Ministers consider that the Joint Supervisory Authority (JSA), the authority intended to supervise the correct operation of the SIS register, has adequate resources and powers to carry out its work in a satisfactory manner?<EOL>
The concept of a hierarchy with one person in charge, telling everyone else what to do is certainly not what is needed here.<EOL>
I believe that Europe - the European Union - is a civilian power with military means, which is very different from a military power, and I believe that this should continue to be the case.<EOL>
This is, therefore, already a major advance.<EOL>
I hope that the Commission will support our views, and for my colleagues in the House and the vote tomorrow I should like to hear what the Commissioner thinks about the debt collection agencies, the bill of exchange, Amendment No 33 on the payment period for public contracts, and sub-contractors.<EOL>
It will enable us to ensure that we have uniform training throughout Europe, a single, recognisable, system, which is accessible and also promotes through-travel; thus increasing the real speed of freight railways, and, with it, safety and reliability.<EOL>
I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous.<EOL>
Some of the amendments cannot be accepted because they propose to change a quotation from a legal text and I refer to Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4.<EOL>
As such, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament needs to be fully informed and consulted with regard to the work carried out by the Joint Committee, as well as all of the entities involved.<EOL>
These ambitions should be adjusted to suit the current economic situation.<EOL>
In addition to the EU draft directive, the International Chamber of Commerce and the OECD have made recommendations on this issue.<EOL>
The practice in force until now of mostly allocating funds towards qualification, requalification and various kinds of training is, to my mind, ineffective.<EOL>
The important thing is to make the proper diagnosis, but also to be able, after the diagnosis, to apply the proper treatment.<EOL>
The interests of the company employees must also be taken into account along with, of course, those of private users and citizens.<EOL>
Thank you very much.<EOL>
The declaration by the Presidency of the European Union of 17 February and resolution 1097 of the Security Council of 18 February are the most recent reference documents on this issue.<EOL>
Four of them are still being held in a secret location, while two Chinese-American missionaries have simply gone missing.<EOL>
We should deepen our commitment to the whole region.<EOL>
Like the Commission, the rapporteur believes this procedure should be refocused towards giving greater right of asylum to applicants who want 'to find safety'.<EOL>
From the Commission side, I can say that we envisage constitutional evolution rather than revolution, which can be done and should be done in respect of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement.<EOL>
As a result, it is becoming clear that MEPs' objections relate to the content rather than form of the agreement.<EOL>
Internal security is of course one of the priorities also emphasised by Parliament in the guidelines for the budgetary procedure for 2003 - next year - which were of course adopted at the last sitting here in Strasbourg.<EOL>
Secondly, the information systems will provide the technical means for cooperation.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
That was what we told our citizens - that institutional reform was necessary in order to achieve more and better results.<EOL>
I think we must consider ourselves on our intellectual strength, our intellectual objectivity, on our intellectual, philosophical, cultural and political freedom of thought.<EOL>
On the other hand, there is a sense in which this is happening as a result of the very thoughtless policy of some of the European Union's Member States, because it is certain that it was absolutely unnecessary to lend credibility to Mr Lukashenko in the eyes of Europe and the European Union as has been done by Mr Berlusconi, who has visited Belarus, the President of Lithuania, Mrs Grybauskaitė, and the foreign ministers of Germany and Poland.<EOL>
When talking of global cumulation, the concept of the EU common market would on the whole become incomprehensible.<EOL>
If this is not the case, we shall vote against.<EOL>
When a similar enquiry was conducted in the Nordic countries, former Minister for Nordic Cooperation Ole Norrback stated that the authorities did not believe that there was a problem in this area, although citizens thought that there was.<EOL>
I think this is an excellent report.<EOL>
It cannot fall below the standards adopted by other transnational institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank or the European Monetary Institute, and neither can it forget the decision on equal treatment for persons of the same sex living in a permanent relationship, which was taken by this House in February 1994.<EOL>
The situation is actually rather different as regards the use of measuring instruments in the health sector.<EOL>
As soon as the presence of avian flu was confirmed to me on 23 January, I put a ban in place within a matter of hours.<EOL>
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, Mr Takkula is no longer here, but he asked a question about whether there is any conflict between having goals at EU level and the fact that the education system will essentially still be a national system.<EOL>
For example, it is going to discuss the unitary EU approach and Europe's position in relation to the G20 in Toronto, which will be the subject of a debate later this morning here in this House.<EOL>
The Europe of Nations Group and the June Movement demand that the Commission should actually resign and be replaced by a clean-up team, which can carry out a clear-out and clean-up operation before a new Commission is selected.<EOL>
This can only be achieved in close cooperation with international financial institutions and partners on site.<EOL>
We had to continue with the agricultural reforms launched in 1992 and maintain the essential elements of economic and social cohesion, whilst taking enlargement and the financial constraints into account.<EOL>
The adoption of the third package, in my view, will also serve to ensure better protection for consumers as well as small and medium-sized professional users.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
In addition, I request that this issue should be included in the debate within the European Union on transatlantic relations, since we, as the European Union, have a very specific responsibility.<EOL>
The bank demonstrated its ability to handle the huge challenges that it faced when the global economic crisis reached the economies in the European Union.<EOL>
If we want to grasp the opportunity of the debate on budgetary resources to talk about expenditure, and hence about the CAP, fine, but what drives us are the real problems of the CAP - the unfair distribution of its benefits - which the President of the Court of Auditors also described to us in this House yesterday.<EOL>
The recent energy crisis between Russia and Ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of many Member States of the European Union that are to a dangerous extent dependent on one supplier.<EOL>
To do this, we need manpower in all those sectors which, one might say, seem to have been somewhat abandoned by many of our fellow citizens of Europe.<EOL>
Mr President, we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe.<EOL>
The crisis in the financial sector has led to more collateral and higher-risk premiums, which means it has become much more difficult to get start-up credits and other financial resources.<EOL>
That was the first point I wished to make.<EOL>
It is important that these efforts are redoubled in order to counter the rise in Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism and discrimination against other minority groups, especially those from new Member States.<EOL>
In my opinion, the Commission could come up with more than these specific proposals, and then we can show businesses that the European institutions are concerned not just with the problems of the multinationals, but also with the problems of small firms and more besides.<EOL>
So we leave the old to the mercy of heatwaves and lethal injections, and we retire folk early and reduce their working hours.<EOL>
This must change: it must stop and stop quickly.<EOL>
To avoid wasteful duplication, it would be better to make full use of the potential offered by these systems and reduce the cost of Earth surveillance.<EOL>
Different problems in different Member States require different national solutions to create the right climate for their businesses to create jobs.<EOL>
We now have the opportunity to use this directive and to provide guarantees for tax administrations.<EOL>
Mr Alvaro, the problem is that, in the different language versions, this phrase was structured in a different way.<EOL>
The impact of this disease on society should be borne and coordinated at European level, guaranteeing equal opportunities for treatment and therefore good results across the board.<EOL>
The euro markets raised USD 1.6 trillion equivalent of finance for business last year and 60% of that finance was in non-euro currencies such as the dollar and the yen.<EOL>
In this context, the point in the Declaration which states that the institutional foundations of Europe have to be agreed by 2009 is of great importance.<EOL>
For example, Annex XI contains a special provision that takes into account the specifics of national legislation.<EOL>
However, at the same time, the number of citizens living below the poverty line also rises.<EOL>

Honourable Members know very well the specifics and the detail of what needs to be addressed but, from my visits not only to Israel and Palestine but within the region, I genuinely feel it is incredibly important to move ahead now, while the world's attention is on the situation, to try and ease the problems in Gaza.<EOL>
But as I said, our critique of the government in this country is the main thing.<EOL>
We were all under the illusion that the new course of Khatami would have made it unnecessary, but that was an illusion!<EOL>
Parliament's support in this respect will be crucial.<EOL>
It is clear that changes are urgently needed on the island, and the European Union should monitor these so that the transition to democracy will benefit the Cuban people.<EOL>
At the refinancing meeting in London, we paid something like an additional EUR 90 million into this Global Fund.<EOL>
We have consequently chosen to vote against this report.<EOL>
The job of the European institutions is to impose rules in response to issues raised by the public.<EOL>
Japan is 20 years ahead of Europe in this, but it was also 20 years ahead of European countries in legalising abortion.<EOL>
I believe that in 2010, particular attention should be focused on programmes for training young entrepreneurs and for supporting them in setting up their own companies.<EOL>
The next item is the report by Alojz Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the White Paper entitled 'Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'.<EOL>
The largest exporters in recent years have been the United States and Russia, each one accounting for 30% of the global arms trade, with the EU not far behind at 20%.<EOL>
Of course Cyprus cannot become a member of the EU if only the Greek population is involved.<EOL>
I believe there are four particularly important principles.<EOL>
But, as everybody expected oil prices to come down to USD 9 per barrel, the world was late, and now we know that we should follow this policy.<EOL>
The next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.<EOL>
It would certainly be in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the October 1999 European Council to proceed in this way.<EOL>
In July of the same year, the Member States supported the extension of ENISA's mandate.<EOL>
That is the truth of the matter.<EOL>
Racism and xenophobia are very often connected with prejudice.<EOL>
We have got some partial goals established, or target values for 2010, and these must be met.<EOL>
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the Union and all the Member States for the aid provided.<EOL>
Interference of this kind from abroad in respect of Dutch legislation in the areas of drugs or euthanasia, for example, could equally meet with the same wave of protest in the Netherlands.<EOL>
B5-0166/2000 by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on Angola;<EOL>
Of course, we must stress that this mainly concerns healthcare workers, but there is another aspect, too: we are also talking about patients who are also at risk from this.<EOL>
That is important for them and it is also important for Israel and for the security of both.<EOL>
We need Great Britain at the table, too, for without Great Britain no success will come of this venture.<EOL>
However, I have to say that in committee we had 275 amendments to this report and we managed to bring it through with virtually no amendments.<EOL>
As long as the Commission is unable to guarantee the exercise of fundamental rights in the EU, its image as a defender of these rights will suffer.<EOL>
I am convinced that the citizens of Europe would not be able to grasp why, however well-meant our intentions, we are today approving an agreement when the Russian Federation is bombing Chechnya and even preventing helpless refugees from fleeing.<EOL>
That is nonsense.<EOL>
It is for this reason that I believe that, even if the decision to approve enhanced cooperation is to be made with caution, this is something that the European Parliament can agree to.<EOL>
Accordingly, the EIB should place emphasis on increasing the granting of credits to small businesses, on defining precise rules as regards assessing its projects, on improving SME access to risk capital and on encouraging access to its activities on the part of local and regional financial partners.<EOL>
One only has to think of the Middle East conflict, where we do not even have a place at the negotiating table.<EOL>
However, the proposed solution is not acceptable to all delegations.<EOL>
Implementation of the existing agreements is vital.<EOL>
I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.<EOL>
Both resolutions cultivate the theory of social assent and social partnership in a bid to bring the workers and other movements to subordination and subjugation to capitalist barbarity.<EOL>
In fact, based on the premise that such controls exist in the fifteen Member States, the Commission has found that there are differences in application.<EOL>
Let us hope that by the implementation of these measures we will make it almost impossible - as impossible as travel by sea can allow - for any repetition of such tragedies to take place.<EOL>
Thank you, Commissioner, for that reply.<EOL>
That is a fact.<EOL>
If these restrictions need to be retained, granting priority seems to me to be a minimum condition for ensuring that citizens from these countries do not feel like second-class European citizens.<EOL>
(EL) Mr President, we should not have been able to debate the proposal to recommend a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) today had not our fellow Member, Mr Mantovani, made good use of the experience of former MEPs working on the subject or collaborated so well with the Commission and the Council.<EOL>
Can you, Mr President, or can the Secretary General of this Parliament confirm that Mr Martin is required to repay EUR 168 000 to the European Parliament following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in respect of irregular accounting?<EOL>
That corresponds to over 10 000 flights from Europe to New York.<EOL>
It wants to absorb the countries of eastern Europe with a mere 1.27 % of the budget, when we know how great were the sacrifices and the ambitions of the American project at the time of the Marshall Plan.<EOL>
Previously, access to them was fraught with complications. Work along these lines must continue, bearing in mind of course that written information, oral information and direct contact with the citizens are nevertheless essential.<EOL>
In my homeland, Sweden, the last filling station on a drive to the north is in Uppsala, which is in the middle of the country.<EOL>
This possibility is especially important due to the emphasis currently placed on employment at European level.<EOL>
It is perhaps enough that interests should be better shared and state taxation better allocated.<EOL>
The fall in coffee prices is indeed catastrophic.<EOL>
In this context the Council deserves the most criticism, but Parliament is also at fault.<EOL>
I should underline that the Commission has already announced that we will soon be putting forward proposals to assist the Turkish community in that unhappy eventuality, which we still hope will not happen.<EOL>
It is important that a system of salaries and expenses for MEPs should be as transparent as possible.<EOL>
It is up to the national authorities to be serious in their response, but I believe we must acknowledge that what is at issue here is more than just isolated Danish/Irish scepticism.<EOL>
We must ensure that, in the rush to globalise, regional transport is not completely marginalised, with whole regions being cut off.<EOL>
The recommendation made to the political parties "to accept more Union citizens who are not nationals of the country concerned as partymembers and candidates on the electoral lists, and to encourage them to take part in political life in their country of residence' is significant here.<EOL>
Let me remind you of the very dangerous mining project of Rosia Montana, threatening us with severe environmental disaster.<EOL>
With regard to two questions which have arisen, firstly, I profoundly regret the nuclear accident in South Korea which has happened just days after the accident in Japan and which has affected a number of workers.<EOL>
I was not sure whether he was addressing me or addressing a group of Member States.<EOL>
This means that the proposal contributes to the Commission's general policy of promoting the online market and online trade.<EOL>
The Iran issue is the kind of issue I have in mind: one in relation to which we can only achieve something if we act together in order peacefully to prevent people from producing atomic bombs.<EOL>
In future, this procedure will certainly play an important role.<EOL>
Of course, there is the major social sector you referred to, where you do not have full employment but you offer social services with certain specific incentives.<EOL>
But we are also committed to other actions under Daphne, and all I wish to know is whether the move from Article 235 to 129 will alter the content of this programme.<EOL>
I happen to be the rapporteur for the still stalled report on the reform of the Paris Convention.<EOL>
The Treaty of Lisbon is bringing the EU out of its downward spiral.<EOL>
We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide.<EOL>
Despite expectations we have fallen well short here of securing full implementation of one of the basic axioms of the European Union, which is equality of access and freedom from linguistic discrimination.<EOL>
- Cecilia Malmström, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on Iran (B6-0113/2004);<EOL>
It is a question which obviously has implications which go beyond the Kaleidoscope programme, since it indirectly affects all the cultural programmes which have just come into force.<EOL>
In fact, according to the news reaching us from the Council this issue has also been discussed.<EOL>
You will remember it was a fierce battle because it went up to the Court of Justice, and the Commission - and I have to pay homage to the Commission - was lucid, more lucid at the time than the Council, and we were fully supporting the Commission.<EOL>
Let me also at this stage thank Parliament for helping make this early decision possible.<EOL>
There is simply no alternative to collective action on this issue.<EOL>
It is there on paper, but in practice, in real life, the services directive has been sidelined, when that directive was all about strengthening competitiveness and putting it into practice.<EOL>
With the texts which we are debating today and will vote on tomorrow, we are building a protective shield here in Europe for the citizens.<EOL>
We will send him the written reply to his question.<EOL>
First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<EOL>
This is only going to cost $100m or $200m, comparatively small beer compared to what is being spent on the KEDO project as a whole, but, clearly, if you do not have the bat and the ball, you cannot play the game.<EOL>
We know that there is a need to fight maternal mortality.<EOL>
Also, with regard to the external actions of the European Investment Bank, on the basis of these financial perspectives the new EIB external mandate has already been adopted.<EOL>
We took those issues on board as we pursued our revision process.<EOL>
Firstly, and here I am in particular addressing Mr Toubon, the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy will be launched by the Commission in the spring of 2009.<EOL>
In terms of the legislative amendments, the Group of the European People's Party is totally opposed to the amendment to Rule 53 concerning the legal basis and is therefore also opposed to Amendment No 38.<EOL>
We shall have to gradually get accustomed to twilight conditions, for example.<EOL>
We think that we have worked excellently together and it is important that the owninitiative report is adopted and that a proposal is made based on it.<EOL>
It applies only to goods vehicles, only on motorways and only to goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more.<EOL>
I also feel it is significant that the Galileo project and the telecommunications and energy network projects have been included in the new regulation, and I welcome the emphasis placed on rail transport as the priority sector, not least with a view to sustainability.<EOL>
I would like to stress the effectiveness of the way in which the baccalaureate examination is organised, as it stimulates high performance and prepares students for their future lives as European citizens.<EOL>
In its Agenda 2000 proposal, the Commission also highlights the importance of competition policy in the Associated Countries throughout the pre-accession stage.<EOL>
We may be able to call on our friends from the Council of Europe too to consider a suspension.<EOL>
Instead, the only guidelines originating from Europe that carry real weight are found in the Stability and Growth Pact, which does the opposite and puts them in a straitjacket.<EOL>
Talks and negotiations are continuing.<EOL>
We must have confidence in the French authorities to carry out this inquiry carefully, with a desire for transparency and with a determination to succeed.<EOL>
In my country there were elections in March.<EOL>
We have tried, over the last six months, to ensure that Europe is united and strong, and that it thinks for itself.<EOL>
He also spoke of greater coordination of economic policies, particularly within the euro area, and the institutional resources required for this cooperation and for the euro area to be represented beyond our borders.<EOL>
Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate the importance of continuing these reforms.<EOL>
This is the third time in this year that this new supervisory body has been the subject of an amending budget.<EOL>
I thank the Commissioner.<EOL>
In addition, it establishes that representatives of the individual professions shall be consulted in future at a European level in relation to any other innovation that concerns them.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to participate in this debate today, together with Mr Söderman, the Ombudsman, whose work in the service of the citizens of the Union is very important. The Commission takes a very positive view of this work.<EOL>
Paris protects it.<EOL>
As far as the Commission is concerned, this is the fifth year in succession that the Court of Auditors has not delivered an unambiguously favourable verdict.<EOL>
Mr President, Nasrin Sotoudeh gave us reason to talk about her in a previous European Parliament debate on the lack of protection of human rights in Iran, when, on 4 September 2010, she was arrested on charges of propaganda against the state, conspiracy and assembling to act against national security.<EOL>
For us European Socialists, the current crisis has nothing to do with fate; it is merely the result of very clear political decisions taken by northern countries in general in a whole range of areas.<EOL>
Ján Slota asserted his anti-Hungarian and anti-Roma views with impunity during the election campaign in Slovakia this spring more and more vociferously, a fact which we have drawn attention to on a number of occasions.<EOL>
The rise in religious intolerance and fanaticism jeopardises a fundamental freedom, freedom of belief for all, whether they are religious or agnostic.<EOL>
The overall package being contributed to the forthcoming WTO negotiations by the European Union puts the ball very firmly in the European Union's court.<EOL>
Unless opinion is open and public, people will not be able to control what those that represent them do.<EOL>
We are trying to cope with this situation as well as we can by concentrating projects and through the efficiency measures we have mentioned.<EOL>
This proposal achieved the first constructive framework agreement.<EOL>
   . Today, this House adopted a resolution about the future of Europe 60 years after the Second World War.<EOL>
To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution.<EOL>
Indeed, the guidelines were a response to a request from the Member States themselves that the Commission should formulate policy orientations, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to facilitate the adjustment exercise at the mid-point of the programmes.<EOL>
I voted for this report because I believe that the accession of the European Union to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) is a strong message that enhances the credibility of the Union in the eyes of third countries which it regularly calls upon to respect the ECHR.<EOL>
First of all, we need to take legislative action to ensure safe decommissioning of nuclear power plants and disposal of radioactive waste in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.<EOL>
Mexico can impose, if applicable, in a non-discriminatory manner levies, taxes, charges, duties or dues on fuel supplied on its own territory for the aircraft of the air carrier appointed by a Member State of the European Community, operating on a route between a point located on Mexican territory and another point located on the territory of another state on the American continent.<EOL>
I can gladly give the honourable Member this assurance because you must bear the following in mind: not all the meat and bonemeal produced in the past was used in feedingstuffs.<EOL>
Tomorrow, we will vote on various amendments that have already been approved in committee. They aim to limit inter-basin transfers to very specific situations where prior authorisation has been granted.<EOL>
I wish to thank my colleague Mr Cramer for his own-initiative report which sets out a full assessment of the implementation of the first package, without omitting to underline nonetheless all the factors which affect the performance of rail and those which hold up the achievement of the objectives that we have set ourselves.<EOL>
The most affected, however, would have been the Palestinian people, who are today surrounded, trapped and starving in their vast open-air prison.<EOL>
Our European agriculture model has received a heavy blow and, because of this, we must swiftly take up these issues.<EOL>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.<EOL>
I think we are very close on this issue.<EOL>
Having a job means the chance of providing for oneself and, in the long term, is the best way to achieve a society in which everyone can feel they are taking part.<EOL>
Other publications include a collection of sketches and stories by children and an educational leaflet on the Natura 2000 network.<EOL>
I am very encouraged by what I have heard so far.<EOL>
I also appreciate that the views of others might differ from my own.<EOL>
Let us remember that 90% of the EU's external trade and almost 40% of its internal trade passes through ports.<EOL>
The second contradiction is that, whereas female employment is increasing, the increase is primarily in part-time, insecure and fixed-term jobs.<EOL>
Since the policy of the IAEA is to concentrate its efforts on the issue of safeguards in countries with no nuclear weapons, a verification problem arose which led to the technical conflict you are referring to today with the question put by the honourable Member.<EOL>
At EU level we have instruments available for dealing with such situations, which supplement the projects carried out by regions.<EOL>
For this, the first agency must disclose certain information regarding the valuated instrument.<EOL>
But, when you look at politics from the point of view of content, it is irresponsible of the European Union not to speak with one voice and to behave like a dwarf in the world when it is in fact an economic global player and - to put it nastily - could in theory push the Secretary-General and representative of the common foreign and security policy around like an operetta general.<EOL>
We believe that the weakest link is the attitude of Member States, since in some Member States - our fellow Member Mrs Grässle spoke just now about Germany in this connection - there is a failure to recognise how very important it is to ensure that EU funds are spent in accordance with the rules, that expenditures are subject to scrutiny, and that any amounts unduly paid are recovered.<EOL>
Our country has been gradually dragged into this conflict.<EOL>
Therefore, this 2020 strategy will be all the stronger if it can be adapted to prevailing circumstances.<EOL>
However, there are considerable differences between the two that need to be very clearly defined.<EOL>
I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry.<EOL>
More than just a simple free trade zone, it is a Union founded on the common civilisation of people who share fundamental values.<EOL>
If, in the meantime, there is progress on the Eurovignette, the relevant agreement will also apply in the case of Austria.<EOL>
They will help to bring about better collaboration and mutual understanding across the globe.<EOL>
Our state and non-state partners, both States and international organisations, are continuing to turn to us and to see us as a major player, and sometimes as indispensable, owing to our political credibility, our influence, our expertise and the instruments we have at our disposal.<EOL>
Therefore, it is not even a strong and independent diplomatic service that is being proposed here, but an instrument of submission to non-European leadership.<EOL>
The debate surrounding globalisation and free trade has received increasing attention.<EOL>
The immediate priority is humanitarian, but beyond that there is a delicate and tangled political mess to sort out.<EOL>
in writing. - The EGAF is an important structural fund in the EU that enables us to aid workers that have been rendered unemployed as a result of the shifts in global trends.<EOL>
In this respect, we as presidency have precisely opted for an approach which steers clear of being proven right or wrong about the 1%, and which moves into the direction of the discussion as to where our priorities and, I should like to add, our posteriorities are.<EOL>
The stability and growth pact is an important and innovative instrument for the greater co-ordination of national budgetary policies which is essential.<EOL>
Until such time, it is not wise to trust to the good intentions of the new European Commission which took up office in the autumn of 1999.<EOL>
Should they relapse, we can always suspend the agreement, although I would not recommend this.<EOL>
With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4, I would like to say that as rapporteur I am opposed to these amendments.<EOL>
We cannot agree to vote on it, hence our request that you put it to the House.<EOL>
I think the aim for harmonization is that there should also be an internal market for construction products.<EOL>
There is also a flip side, namely the lack of a civil society.<EOL>
(PL) Mr President, in the field of civil justice, apart from the acquis communautaire, there are a number of bilateral agreements which were concluded by Member States with third countries.<EOL>
Many of us cherish the hope that there are some small 'green shoots' in your speech, in the promises that you made to our group, in the speech by Commissioner Andor and in the institutional agreement that we have to submit future European legislation for environmental impact assessment.<EOL>
Giving you more power will only work if you actually use the power you already have.<EOL>
Over the last six months we have endeavoured to draw up a draft action plan on European e-justice that is as balanced as possible, by taking account of the Member States involved in this project, of this House's position, but also of the role that will have to be played by the Commission.<EOL>
For a large majority of people, it is important for this freedom to be retained without facing unnecessary barriers to cross borders.<EOL>
I agree with him that a tax on environmental pollution can be a viable alternative, but this will no longer be effective once the environment has become truly clean.<EOL>
The Lisbon reforms must be carried through, implemented and developed in all Member States of the Union.<EOL>
I have already said this before the House, and I confirm it today.<EOL>
What is this compromise about?<EOL>
Mr President, I want to concentrate on one area only.<EOL>
It is important to emphasise that there is no scientific advice available to us to the effect that the force-feeding itself, as distinct from the conditions under which the animals are kept, is contrary to animal welfare.<EOL>
While ensuring high quality, safe and efficient cross-border healthcare, it is important to ensure a proper balance between the right of EU patients to seek treatment abroad and the capacity of national health systems and national healthcare priorities.<EOL>
European legislation should not be adding to the uncertainty that people feel about their retirement.<EOL>
The achievement of a large portion of these objectives does not depend simply on the Commission and Parliament.<EOL>
And this effect will be all the more pronounced if the euro does not produce all the benefits expected.<EOL>
Is it necessary for animals to be transported across half of Europe to be slaughtered?<EOL>
Of course, I am not giving anything away when I tell you that on some pivotal issues a compromise has not yet been reached.<EOL>
That has resulted in an imbalance of compensation which is why the system now makes heavy demands, or heavier than justifiable demands, on the budget and why we will bring it to an end.<EOL>
On the basis of our Rules of Procedure, this means that the matter must be referred back to the Committee on Budgetary Control and the debate must continue between Parliament and the Commission.<EOL>
By means of forceful pressure from its largest trade partner, the EU, Libya really should be made to pay attention to what respect for human rights and freedoms means and what these entail.<EOL>
I should also like to point out to Mr Bolkestein that the course currently taken by matters has led to unrest in the US too.<EOL>
Two weeks ago, the Commission published a communication giving precise instructions as to how the appropriations are to be used.<EOL>
Solid proof of this is the impact on the media that the transport of waste (and pollutants), in particular by sea and inland waterway, has had recently.<EOL>
This is an unacceptable situation, especially since effective alternative methods are already available. Because of a clear lack of political will, however, these are not being promoted.<EOL>
Of course he must back every member of his team - we would expect nothing less from a leader in his position - and, in organising his team, although we question some portfolios, he has probably done his best with what he has got.<EOL>
Mr President, as you would quite rightly assume, I am going to speak against the suggestion from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.<EOL>
What is at issue is precisely documents, the authors and customers of which are able decide that their content of even their existence is kept secret.<EOL>
The EU has given sustained political support to help the people of Ukraine find a peaceful outcome to the crisis.<EOL>
It is also applicable to Amendment No 2 on compliance with IAEA regulations and on Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which would add a number of safety requirements issuing from the INF code to the annexes of the directive.<EOL>
in writing. - (PT) Protection of the environment is a politically important issue in Europe which has developed rapidly in recent years and in which research continues to be a priority for the Union.<EOL>
   . – Madam President, as we all know, Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys.<EOL>
We need legally-based rights, as this report points out, at an international level.<EOL>
I think we must also provide significant support for the efforts made by countries no longer using nuclear energy to move away from this type of energy completely.<EOL>
A crucial debate on the topic of enlargement is taking place in the Dutch Lower House today.<EOL>
The consumer's right to conduct small electronic transactions under a pseudonym can also serve to prevent the creation of excessively detailed customer profiles.<EOL>
They are the backbone of their future.<EOL>
Having said that, when discussing the Europe of values, you referred to the need to export the system of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to third countries.<EOL>
This report once again demonstrates that the EU is a world leader with respect to global warming.<EOL>
My group is not in favour of a shorter timescale, as Mr Jonckheer has proposed.<EOL>
Amendments have now been tabled to narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of a natural resource service.<EOL>
Like you, I believe that there are huge areas for possible improvements.<EOL>
To my colleague behind me, I would like to say that, when I was a Member of the Swedish Parliament, I stayed home with my son for six months on paternity leave.<EOL>
We are nonetheless aware that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position.<EOL>
That is the biggest disincentive to investment which will hit job opportunities.<EOL>
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that it is essential for the EU to be prepared for the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) risks which have given a new dimension to terrorist attacks, to industrial accidents and to natural disasters, since such risks know no borders and could result in innumerable victims.<EOL>
Both the Greek government and the Commission owe us an answer.<EOL>
Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well, or would we try to hold George Bush back?<EOL>
Because again it seems, as Mrs van Dijk has said, that the eight-hour limit that we now have is a dead letter.<EOL>
Visa liberalisation in the Western Balkans is not a jigsaw puzzle with which you might wish to amuse yourselves.<EOL>
Any community that does not have close links to employment, salaries and productivity becomes unfair, however, and, at the end of the day, becomes poorer.<EOL>
They cannot have any.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard' s question is very important.<EOL>
To set standards will be very difficult technically and it could even have consequences that work against our objective of reducing CO2 emissions.<EOL>
The agreement was criticised by some artists' groups who told us they believed that the new directive would, paradoxically, cause unacceptable discrimination between famous artists and those who are in difficulty, that it would give no support at all to artists who need it most.<EOL>
What matters is getting the mechanisms moving and getting employment moving.<EOL>
We want to reinforce maternity and family leave.<EOL>
And the first to suffer are the people at the bottom of the pile, the people on the lowest rung of the industry such as those who work in the entertainment industry without steady employment, who are currently on strike in France in protest against what is threatening to exacerbate their already precarious situation.<EOL>
As regards the use of nuclear energy, the Presidency is of the firm opinion that the decision on the introduction, further use and possible increase in the use of nuclear energy is entirely up to the Member States.<EOL>
(DE) The revised Amendment 6 has been withdrawn.<EOL>
Thank you very much, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, and I predict that we shall have six months of intense but pleasant and fruitful work.<EOL>
Of course, that does not mean that public finances and economic performance are not also a matter of collective interest.<EOL>
They are an attempt to protect the monopolies' obscene profits from the grass-roots protest and opposition being pumped up by barbaric capitalism and cruel liberal policies.<EOL>
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, my fellow Members have presented you with a series of requests for more progress in European schools, which serve as examples for other schools in the Member States.<EOL>
The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs.<EOL>
Mr President, this motion celebrates the good news, the successful ending of the Sharm el-Sheikh negotiations and the agreement of safe passage for Palestinian goods, vehicles and people.<EOL>
Both sides have benefited from cooperation under the Fifth Framework Programme: Israel gains access to a more extensive network of research institutes, while the EU is able to tap Israel’s innovative potential.<EOL>
The report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, whom I should like to thank most sincerely for taking on the task and for the provisions full of common sense which she has included regarding the rules for participation, has set us on the right track.<EOL>
It is a good thing that the question is now on the agenda but this hardly helps the employees in Norrköping - a town which has experienced major structural change and has a high level of unemployment - if they cannot get an answer to the question which they have asked us and which we have tried to get an answer to, namely whether regional political aid has been paid out in this case.<EOL>
Globalisation and a growing international division of labour can only be established and influenced by a Community with strong instruments at its disposal.<EOL>
This is why we need the single European market as a response to globalisation.<EOL>
I am delighted, Commissioner, that you share our positions on the extent of this phenomenon and on the need to combat it with every preventive and repressive measure in the host country and in the countries of origin.<EOL>
I am happy to say that the Commission has recently taken a number of measures within the dairy sector in an attempt to try to end the downward spiral of prices.<EOL>
How much are renewable energy sources being subsidised?<EOL>
It is good for you to fully understand this, because there will come a time when someone has to be responsible for it.<EOL>
I think we have achieved some positive results from working together.<EOL>
Formal sitting - Hungary<EOL>
I voted for this report because I feel that Estonia really deserves to join the euro area.<EOL>
Madam President, I too subscribe to what my colleagues have said and I am astonished that, in a country like Tunisia, where there has been economic progress and an improvement in the living conditions of the population, proper democratization of the country has not developed at the same time.<EOL>
In 2007, the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised.<EOL>
      Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union automatically increased the number of countries with a stake in the Barcelona process.<EOL>
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, someone has already pointed out - I think it was Mr Provan - that we should have been informed that a vote was taking place and what it was about.<EOL>
It is a remarkable coincidence that in Strasbourg environmental work always seems to take place on Tuesday nights.<EOL>
The four which are currently authorised are not used in any human antibiotic drugs.<EOL>
Let us call for that.<EOL>
As some Members have rightly stated to me in writing, after 15 years of continuous European Community efforts and involvement, this represents a significant and visible success for the Community in an important area of disease prevention and health promotion for European citizens.<EOL>
In the event, the Budgetary Control Committee adopted its report in blissful ignorance of what was going on.<EOL>
This is the cynical part of the Left's feminist rhetoric as it uses gender to classify discriminations which are actually social.<EOL>
Mr President, the full report on Tuesday night's sitting, which I only received yesterday, included my speech on the oral question on Alzheimer's disease.<EOL>
The Schengen system, in the guise of a gradual abolition of controls at the internal borders of the EU countries concerned, reinforces controls at the borders of the Union itself and makes conditions of access stricter.<EOL>
On the other hand, regional differences have also grown. It is therefore very clear that regional aid will be needed in the future too, as Mr Puerta suggested.<EOL>
There is therefore no need for me to repeat myself now.<EOL>
Europe must surely not allow itself to be characterised by the pursuit of a policy of non-resistance and appeasement in the face of the present dangers.<EOL>
(SK) Mr President, economic migration is a fact that is more or less familiar to all the more affluent countries of the European Union.<EOL>
in writing. - (PT) The recent financial crisis has highlighted major weaknesses in financial supervision, both in individual cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole.<EOL>
That is why we are insisting that the UN's conventions on refugees should apply in all situations, even in the EU.<EOL>
Huge numbers of people oppose live exports; they are unnecessary, cruel and unjustifiable.<EOL>
in writing. - For many MEPs the existence of the Guantánamo Bay prison became a stick with which to beat America.<EOL>
As my second point, I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recital A. Alas, this besotted committee feels it cannot speak without showing cringing deference to the illfated Constitution, ever peddling the lie that it will deepen democracy, when in reality it is assetstripping every nation state of more democracy and more power.<EOL>
Mr President, if we want the people of Europe to feel an attachment to the European Union, then the EU must show solidarity with its people when they are struck by misfortune, as in the south of France.<EOL>
   I fully subscribe to the Lisbon goals of strengthening employment, economic reform, enhancing competitiveness, completing the internal market, Social Cohesion and environmental protection as engines of a sustainable growth-orientated economy.<EOL>
Inadequate advances in the areas of the first and second pillars will set the seal on the failure of the conference, and the European Parliament will have the duty of relaying that disappointment.<EOL>
This applies not least to drugs cooperation, as progress needs to be faster on this matter.<EOL>
Moreover, companies need to take responsibility and invest more than they do now in transmission and emergency capacity.<EOL>
There are many regional programmes, for example in my home region of Rheinland-Pfalz, and these demonstrate that this is feasible and have led the way here.<EOL>

Should the Union have spoken with a single voice by giving the Commission an exclusive mandate regardless of the skill of the negotiators?<EOL>
The European continent shows the general characteristics of a region located in the planet's northern hemisphere and has forests with highly differentiated coniferous and non-coniferous species which reflect the regional biodiversity and bio-climatic wealth of the old Europe.<EOL>
We will continue to follow up closely the developments of this case.<EOL>
Navigation for the blind, planning the most accessible routes for the disabled, assistance for those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, or rapid location of people in emergency situations are all examples of applications geared towards improving lifestyles.<EOL>
I am in favour of the compromise that was reached within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.<EOL>
Fourthly, even though the prevention and resolution of conflicts by non-military means will always be at the heart of any security strategy adopted by the European Union, the credibility of the European Foreign and Security Policy is, in the final analysis, dependent on the quality of its military capabilities and on the political willingness to deploy them in the event of any conflict.<EOL>
This is one of the insufferable burdens of EU membership and a salutary warning against the increasing Brussels' control which the new Constitution would bring upon us, given the socio-economic dogma which it contains in Part III.<EOL>
My task as President-in-Office of the Council is to ensure that the Union' s regulations are highlighted in the negotiations and that we run the negotiations so as to achieve a change in legislation, markets and political systems in the countries now seeking to join the Union.<EOL>
However, one ingredient is missing - we mention it in our report and hope that the Gothenburg Summit will address the same aspect - and that is also to link the ecological aspects to this process and to these issues.<EOL>
All that shows how Europe can be made, Commissioner, not just through the economy, but through a major cultural initiative, of which Parliament should take full note.<EOL>
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.<EOL>
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I am not without certain views to the effect that the matter has taken an eternity.<EOL>
This is an element of strategic partnership that we must promote in the area of climate change and energy policy.<EOL>
This is why the Commission, although it supports the spirit of Parliament's amendments, is unable to accept them: such a modification, Mr President, would delay the proposal's adoption.<EOL>
I would say that the EUR 238 million proposed for Socrates is simply not enough to do a sensible job.<EOL>
Systematic dialogue with local and regional authorities, investment in better training for women and men working in the sector - 80 % of whom are fairly unskilled, greater attention to preventive measures, better technical assistance from the Commission and enshrinement of the principle for selecting the most beneficial or least prejudicial measures for the environment are - as Mr Hatzidakis says - fundamental factors for making progress on the road to a Community regional policy increasingly committed to our environment and with the already established principle of sustainable development.<EOL>
We hope that these amendments will meet with the approval of the House.<EOL>
It has been a positive achievement, not just for the people of the United Kingdom, and not just for the people of the European Union, but also for the European Parliament.<EOL>
There is always the problem that people will go and see a national film in the country where it is made, but then the difficulties start when it crosses the border.<EOL>
I voted in favour of this report because in order to successfully revitalise the EU Single Market and to increase the global competitiveness of the EU as a whole and to create new jobs, it is necessary to adopt and implement many measures that would promote sustainable business growth and development.<EOL>
On 19 March it therefore decided on new PHARE programme pre-accession guidelines.<EOL>
The EU, which is the wealthiest Community of states in the world, cannot allow itself to continue to allow a country to let dozens of shipwrecks perish in the sea due to a lack of practical measures.<EOL>
We have discussed issues much less directly relevant to us in separate debates here.<EOL>
It makes no difference whether you are a member of the European Union or not.<EOL>
The interpretation and the implementation of the Posted Workers Directive fall short in both respects.<EOL>
The Commission proposes an allocation of EUR 90 million in the Community budget.<EOL>
The facts show it to be so and history shows it to be so: there will be no improvement in the economic situation. Therefore I believe that it would be better to make the Turkish troops withdraw first, and then intervene with financial aid.<EOL>
The European Union is aware of the seriousness of the crisis in Chad and its regional dimension, which I have mentioned before.<EOL>
The proposal for a regulation amending the financing instrument for development cooperation aims to support the main banana-exporting countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) through measures known as Banana Accompanying Measures.<EOL>
It also applies that the EU should not treat third countries like this.<EOL>
Unfortunately we have recently seen more examples of what I would term creative compartmentalisation.<EOL>
We have an historic opportunity to give the States the tools to influence the reality of economic policies and the Member States' economic and industrial strategies, so let us make the most of it.<EOL>
I have sat in the pit of this Chamber since we came here two years ago and before that, from 1989, across on the other side of the canal.<EOL>
The debate and discussions generated by the Green Paper will be incorporated into the Commission's White Paper for consideration by the Council this year.<EOL>
A4-0059/98 by Mr Gary Titley, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council on an action plan for Ukraine (COM(96)0593 - C4-0103/97); -A4-0063/98 by Mrs Magdalene Hoff, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 6/97 concerning TACIS subsidies to Ukraine (C4-0350/97).<EOL>
However, the risk of poverty among women is primarily due to the situation of single-parent families headed by women.<EOL>
This is precisely where our main concerns lie.<EOL>
While we ponder solutions to this acute problem, we also need to examine its causes.<EOL>
But you could not do even this today.<EOL>
I agree that not enough research has been done on this question to know whether the vital parts of cells or the basic building-blocks of human life are being destroyed by this radiation.<EOL>
In line with the practice established for all candidate countries, the Commission will assess Turkey' s national programme for adopting the acquis in the 2001 regular report on the basis of the accession partnership.<EOL>
Taking into consideration the characteristics of hydrogen, vehicles require specific treatment from rescue services.<EOL>
The biggest obstacle to the introduction of an EU copyright, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, is that it would absolutely have to take precedence over national copyright in order to be effective.<EOL>
I therefore hope that in future, at other conferences too - for this was not a one-off problem, but one that also plays a part elsewhere - better cooperation will be established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.<EOL>
These are the things which unite us.<EOL>
This local project fully supports the extension of zerotolerance campaigns to other European countries, backed up by rape crisis telephone helplines, also absent in many of our countries.<EOL>
boost and create new mechanisms of repression,<EOL>
I welcome Article 5 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets, which stresses that budgetary procedures, in particular on discharge, will have to comply with ordinary law, should the Convention's remit be extended beyond the period originally projected.<EOL>
We are stumbling around in an economic desert, but rather like the soldiers – the French Foreign Legionnaires in – suddenly we have seen a vision: the services directive.<EOL>
I believe that we also have historic and humanitarian commitments to a peaceful outcome.<EOL>
But does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area?<EOL>
People had better not say to us that their patience was exhausted, that Hamas had been warned and that humanitarian aid will continue to be granted.<EOL>
Madam Commissioner, my question is how the Commission will reflect on the Israeli non-paper and especially how will the Commission work on a new action plan?<EOL>
Such methodology concerns all road transport except emergency, rescue and military vehicles.<EOL>
The point about this is that the process of applying for permission in a Member State is described as a registration procedure but has in practice degenerated into a licensing procedure.<EOL>
The report that we have drawn up and the amendments that we are putting to you reflect the debate following which the House adopted, in March of this year, a resolution on violence against women.<EOL>
I come from a region where we have a traditional industry, the ceramics industry, that is facing this kind of pressure.<EOL>
Quite the contrary of what has been planned, we ask that measures be taken to promote the shipbuilding and maritime business in the Member States. We should give them a boost, by putting right the unfair competitive practices at global level, by maintaining the system of State aid, and introducing Community preference for shipbuilding, in order to promote the purchase of ships built in European yards.<EOL>
At the time, Gordon Brown was President-in-Office of the Council, and he stated quite clearly back then that the European Parliament had played a major role in the historic process of monetary union.<EOL>
With this thought in mind, we took initiatives, as soon as we assumed the Presidency, for an initial evaluation of the adequacy of our framework for cooperation with Russia.<EOL>
   Mr President, all that I am asking is for you to implement the provisions of Rule 162(3), under which one fifth of Members of Parliament may call for a secret ballot.<EOL>
I consider it appropriate that the European Union should do more to combat inefficiencies, including fighting to combat against tax havens, the manipulation of trading prices and the weakness of the international structure.<EOL>
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, France, of course, nurtured the Ayatollah Khomeini and flew him back to Tehran.<EOL>
The same applies to the language research network, MERCATOR.<EOL>

A third country invoking exclusively reasons of its own national security can apparently impose upon Europe, including directly upon private companies, the level of access to, use, and even protection of, data.<EOL>
Five groups have come together and agreed on a text that denounces discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and which is intended to protect homosexuals, lesbians, transgendered people and bisexuals.<EOL>
I am relieved that the European Parliament has argued against the automatic liberalisation of national rail transport in 2017.<EOL>
It is an attempt to continue to develop the Union into a federation, and it in no way takes account of how the robust enlargement process should influence the Union' s institutional development.<EOL>
I am afraid there are no procedures that would allow us to come back to this issue.<EOL>
Finally, in order to prevent ill treatment and violence, I propose the creation of a European centre for children in danger, which would have the task of promoting the exchange of know-how and making available a European register of children who have disappeared and of culprits who have received sentences, drawn up in cooperation with the national police and judicial authorities and Europol.<EOL>
<EOL>
I totally support that, as it will also mean cooperation between two cultural capitals.<EOL>
The law in force is the Treaty of Nice.<EOL>
We suggested that the Commission should produce quarterly or six-monthly reports in order to try to anticipate at an earlier stage any changes that should or might be made with Parliament's knowledge.<EOL>
The debate and vote today in the European Parliament on the eight reports which aim to combat it are important.<EOL>
Mass slaughter, carried out in the name of the much-vaunted precautionary principle, is becoming much less acceptable, especially because consumer confidence has not returned as a result of this sacrifice.<EOL>
It is they who need our support so that more people are able to cross the border cheaply.<EOL>
   Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).<EOL>
All that these prisoners want is to have a fair trial.<EOL>
This is not a kindergarten; if we do not know what they have done, we cannot take responsibility for it, otherwise we make ourselves a laughing stock the world over.<EOL>
Indeed so, for we read in the , compiled by the European Institute for Strategic Studies, that Lothar Rühl, former secretary of state in the German Ministry of Defence and the paper’s joint author, has summed the matter up in the following words: ‘We have not avoided the presentation of scenarios in which the European Member States’ nuclear forces can influence planning.’<EOL>
Our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevailed has been confirmed throughout the period from the start of 2006 to mid-2007 by cross-checking with the monetary analysis.<EOL>
We are currently in a phase in which each Member State is drawing up its own plan based on its own particular problem areas.<EOL>
A short time ago we voted for a deferral of this report and I think anyone who really wants to address the question of human rights in Egypt must vote in favour of this report.<EOL>
For the sake of the 500 or so million citizens that we represent, we need to learn from this crisis so that we can deal with any new pandemic threats more effectively.<EOL>
A fair division of the family and domestic responsibilities of women and men will help to resolve the situation.<EOL>
Although our choice can of course be criticised, neither its coherence nor its clarity can be disputed.<EOL>
If, however, I ask myself whether the Union’s benefits are felt and understood by its citizens, if I see how people react to enlargement, if I see how the Commission and all other European institutions are, time and again, associated with fraud, if I conclude that the image of the European institutions has not improved – it is enough to look at the latest Eurobarometer surveys – then I have to say that the policy has certainly failed in one area, and that is building bridges with the public.<EOL>
Mr President, in my country fisherwomen represent all that is strongest and most courageous.<EOL>
It concentrates its efforts on controlling the channelling of information from state broadcasting stations, national and regional newspapers and private channels, the overwhelming majority of which are in the hands of capital, the Internet and so forth, so as to formulate the exact content which will put a gloss on its European imperialist policy, making it attractive and persuasive in the eyes of the peoples.<EOL>
Although they ought to be pedagogical and completely neutral, the explanations interpret laws in a rather minimal sense.<EOL>
report (A5-0078/2002) by Mr von Boetticher, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain and the French Republic with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Decision amending Article 40(1) and (7) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders [11896/2001 - C5-0563/2001 - 2001/0820(CNS)].<EOL>
Health is the most important asset in everyone's life.<EOL>
It is up to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to implement the necessary measures that were drawn up within the context of the Community.<EOL>
It is in our own interests that lasting peace and democracy should prevail there.<EOL>
Israel has mighty allies outside of Europe too.<EOL>
(The vote took place) We shall now scrutinize the vote.<EOL>
We will continue to push EU governments to take more detainees for resettlement, both out of transatlantic solidarity and out of guilt at their own complicity, and we will resist Chinese threats regarding the Uighurs.<EOL>
In these countries people must be made aware of the need to save precious drinking water resources.<EOL>
That is why I ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to keep watch and to work to ensure that within Member States, there is no violation of any European people's right to use its mother tongue and no discrimination against its citizens, and that all native languages are considered official within their respective territories.<EOL>
Commissioner, we are counting on you not to lower your guard.<EOL>
I would point out to the House that yesterday, in the House of Commons, the new British Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook, had this to say: ' It is our wish and intention to introduce a new electoral system based on lists and proportional representation for the next European elections.' .<EOL>
The problem is that some of the Member States have had Socialist governments, and in all these governments, in all these countries, we have seen the deficit going up a result of the policies you advocated.<EOL>
That is important if we really want to strike at the roots of the intolerance and xenophobia that are once more rearing their heads in Europe.<EOL>
Mr Wiersma also said how disappointed he was that I have not agreed to take a troika to Serbia immediately.<EOL>
I should first of all like to thank the Portuguese President sincerely and to recognise how very successful the Portuguese Presidency has been.<EOL>
Member States should stop dragging their feet and ratify this Convention speedily.<EOL>
I believe it was Mr Clark who said the Commission was exceeding its competences and that the European Training Foundation could be counterproductive.<EOL>
By illegally reducing the number of sessions for 2004 from 12 to 10, a coalition of honourable Members, whose antipathy to the notion of Strasbourg as seat of the European Parliament has long been known, has seriously undermined the treaties. These honourable Members have also, and no less importantly, undermined this town's status as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation.<EOL>
As a result of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the situation has grown worse, and we have seen an increase in tensions and violence, particularly of an anti-Islamic nature.<EOL>
It relates to the conditions of movement and taxation of goods subject to excise duty, in particular alcohol and tobacco purchased by private consumers.<EOL>
Mr President, the Commission is appreciative of the rapporteur's excellent work and welcomes the recommendation on the Council common position which reflects Parliament's commitment to assist the new South Africa.<EOL>
In the European Union all is really not well, because some of the Member States that have ratified Kyoto are in the process of increasing their emissions of CO2, notably Spain.<EOL>
Many respected newspapers have also given their pages over to this.<EOL>
As a member of an ethnic minority traditionally present in the European Union, I am particularly pleased that the rights of ethnic minorities are mentioned as individual rights for the first time in Article 2.<EOL>
Of course, those responsible for this situation are the politicians who allow unrestrained action to ship owners who, in many ways, are forcing their crews to work very hard in exceptionally dangerous conditions, very often pushing them to the limits of human endurance.<EOL>
The crisis that the fisheries sector has long endured, which is due to aspects such as the commercialisation of fisheries, namely how first sale prices are established, has been exacerbated by the dramatic rise in the price of fuel.<EOL>
Other countries have also been named.<EOL>
(LT) The way out of the complicated economic and financial crisis was not as effective as we had hoped.<EOL>
He or she would be accountable both to the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, Mr Solana, and also to Commissioners Patten and Liikanen, and would be charged with developing a common defence and procurement plan.<EOL>
Forest adaptation and resilience should be given special consideration in the creation of an EU-adaptation fund.<EOL>
And, now, unfortunately, we have the case of the Prestige, showing that this is sadly true: what causes the greatest destruction are these accidents; the old and unsafe oil tankers that still sail around our coasts.<EOL>
The Council will take special care to ensure that women may participate, and participate fully, in building the country' s future.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago, we saw the shocking images on the television of huge areas of Poland and other Central European countries under the flood waters.<EOL>
The most significant aspects are practical ones.<EOL>
Our problem is the opinion which we must deliver prior to the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, i.e. as early as January.<EOL>
Similarly, the fifteen-day deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information does, I think, give government agencies time enough, while ensuring that interested parties are able to use information promptly and efficiently.<EOL>
Such differences of climate can be compensated for only after an indefinite period of time and with a fully-functioning internal market, so we should allow ourselves some time for this.<EOL>
The Netherlands gives 15 euro cents and the UK 4 euro cents.<EOL>
I am in favour of exploiting all opportunities, but not in silence: we have to ask, and ask forcefully.<EOL>
What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure?<EOL>
The introduction of the euro as a single currency was a huge challenge.<EOL>
The pace of integration of the Western Balkan countries is individual and depends on the merits of each one of them with regard, in particular, to their determination to satisfy all the requirements, meet all the obligations, carry out all the reforms and adopt the necessary measures that EU membership implies.<EOL>
It is key to providing an economic to a single currency area which has no federal government and to ensuring macro-economic stability on a sustainable basis.<EOL>
This is a European issue because it has a cross-border dimension.<EOL>
The Commission is confident that it will succeed in this.<EOL>
It is completely contradictory.<EOL>
Congress must act; the Government cannot.<EOL>
I believe that it is important for there to be trust between the institutions and for each to recognise the competence of the others.<EOL>
Now, in reality, that is not the problem.<EOL>
The area of public contracts is also an ideal area for taking account of people with disabilities.<EOL>
If rules such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria had been adhered to, we would not have the level of debt crisis that we currently have in many Member States.<EOL>
I am satisfied with a debate that has, to all intents and purposes, celebrated the work that we do – which pleases me – and that I believe has given due importance to a significant day for Parliament, if a conclusion is reached.<EOL>
(The sitting was suspended at 8.00 p.m.)<EOL>
I should like to quote from the letter which President Pöttering sent to me as chairman of the Committee on International Trade.<EOL>
Recent studies I have examined show that the model of society that best favours equality is that involving a public welfare system and relatively high taxes etc.<EOL>
Not a single Member voted against it; nor did anyone oppose it any of the committees that were asked for their opinion.<EOL>
Clearly, I support these views at a political level but, I repeat, I do have some reservations of an institutional nature in the current circumstances - in relation to consumer policy, competence and the Treaty itself.<EOL>
How secure is the situation in the European Community regarding labelling obligations?<EOL>
I honestly believe that the Martens report underlines this on many occasions and that, in this respect, we are totally in agreement.<EOL>
We had a technical problem here, so it was somewhat longer than a minute.<EOL>
President-in-Office, last week at the Council you barely discussed the legal basis on which the next Commission will be formed, but it is no longer only Ireland which is unlikely to ratify Lisbon.<EOL>
The international community has tolerated this for much too long.<EOL>
After all, there are many arguments for and against it.<EOL>
I am sorry I was not here at the beginning.<EOL>
The Spanish delegation will therefore oppose most of these amendments, given that gradual progress will be made in the future.<EOL>
In other words, it says 'family' , not 'family in its various forms' .<EOL>
In respect of this last requirement, industrial applicability, the directive makes it clear that the industrial application of the gene must be specified in the patent application.<EOL>
The Fifth Framework Programme must be got off the EU decision-making treadmill as quickly as possible, so that competitive European research can continue without interruption when the present phase of the programme has ended.<EOL>
As I said in reply to Mr Virgin's supplementary question, the matter would have looked different if it was a question of Directive 97/11/EC, but this Directive will not be implemented by the Member States until March 1999, and until it is implemented, we cannot of course use the provisions it contains.<EOL>
The second point is that the missile defence shield, and the installations that form part of it, will not be a magnet for terrorists.<EOL>
They have no laboratories available to them and, given the way feedingstuffs look nowadays, they can glean no information about the content from either the appearance, smell or taste.<EOL>
Mr President, I wish to thank our fellow MEP, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for the sterling work she has done.<EOL>
The energy supply must target a combined approach to grassroots needs, a reduction in energy dependency, the safeguarding of local security, environmental protection and, most importantly, the protection of energy as a social rather than a commercial commodity, and this is where our strategic difference and divergence lie: the Green Paper does not promote such needs.<EOL>
its defence of the militarisation of the 'fight against terrorism', examples of which are changing the current concept of defence to what is being called a 'broader concept of security', which includes 'pre-emptive strikes', such as we are seeing now, at the hands of George W. Bush, confusing Member States' internal security missions with defence policy;<EOL>
I would be happy to see the British queen getting less; in Hungary too there are a great many large-scale holdings at present.<EOL>
These words not only summarise the underlying notions and philosophy behind the unification of Europe, but also help to perceive the spirit of Europe.<EOL>
Mr President, it has been a most interesting debate.<EOL>
The promotion of the respect of human rights and of democracy is an integral part of the Union's foreign policy.<EOL>
Mrs Schleicher has once again pointed to the basic declaration by the President of the Commission.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, clearly, energy efficiency is a very important subject, and naturally we have to be very economical with fossil fuels.<EOL>
I can go so far as to say that the result of our work, which the Chamber will vote on tomorrow, fully represents the positions contained in these two studies, namely the creation of a small, flexible, independent institute, structured around networks, capable of analysing the data and the reasons for the discrimination that still exists, examining good practice and finding and publicising innovative standards-based and legislative solutions in the field of women's rights and equal opportunities.<EOL>
Third point: with regard to the timetable, this proposal that the college of Commissioners adopted on 2 July came too late for us to be able to envisage a first reading during our Presidency, but we will press on with negotiations in the Council as far as we can, while entering into a political dialogue with the European Parliament.<EOL>
Hunting issues must be decided at national or local level, not in Brussels.<EOL>
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.<EOL>
It was not to give them hunger, famine, despair and death.<EOL>
This is firstly because the new Lisbon Treaty will contain provisions that require a new institutional set-up, so it will also have a good basis for decisions on the budget.<EOL>
In our opinion this implies, among other aspects, appropriate vocational training, improvement of working conditions, promotion of stable contractual arrangements and fair and dignified levels of pay.<EOL>
You have made it clear that this is not about surveillance or spying.<EOL>
What I look for from the Summit is that new projects will be called into being, such as intensive cooperation between Europol and the United States security services and the networking of police databases, ranging from Europol to Schengen via Olaf, so that these might be used against terrorism; that Eurojust should become the reality to which Mr Poettering has just referred, working closely with Europol; and that Europol should be developed in the direction of the first pillar, with authority to conduct investigations; and that the intergovernmental level should be abandoned in favour of the European in closely circumscribed areas of organised crime.<EOL>
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.<EOL>
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cosmetic products.<EOL>
But it must keep to everything that other candidates keep to - no more and no less!<EOL>
Not only was this a hazard to the cameraman's life and limb but it was also a hazard to any Member's life and limb.<EOL>
Mr Poettering is right to say that what is said by that country’s President touches and affects us all.<EOL>
It must be possible for vessels fishing in one area to land the catch in a port in another area.<EOL>
In future too it must be a matter of principle that the IMO should be in charge of international maritime safety by concluding international agreements, passing resolutions and agreeing conventions.<EOL>
On this latter occasion the Member States adopted a protocol attached to the Nice Treaty which details the arrangements regarding the expiry of this Treaty.<EOL>
In the longer term, it could be that, quite unintentionally, businesses become more vulnerable owing to technical defects in a costly transport system and that jobs could, at short notice, be moved to areas with lower wages, poorer working conditions and fewer environmental requirements.<EOL>
There is no question of an EU tax.<EOL>
For example, in Germany, my homeland, a so-called 'tariff fidelity law' is under discussion, which will in fact - and I share Mr Kuhne's view on this - mean that tendering will not be on the basis of the generalised collective agreements - which are like laws that one must obey - but rather on the basis of tariff agreements, ranging from regional down to in-house, a condition that will make it possible to put a contract out to tender in such a way that only one enterprise ends up being able to participate in the process.<EOL>
For years now, the Court of Auditors has not carried out specific audits or surveys, for example of Eurostat.<EOL>
If we do not show that we mean what we say, it will be difficult to expect others to keep their promises and fulfil their obligations.<EOL>
   – Mrs Flesch, I should like to congratulate you mainly on the tone of the positive, yet critical, remarks in your explanation.<EOL>
I think the safety of the nuclear plants in central and eastern Europe will keep us busy for many years to come.<EOL>
Can we really say that the European Union's present main objective is the maintenance of existing structures in the fishing industry?<EOL>
In fact, a woman has never been appointed to lead Europe, and therefore if we are creating a new European institution, it would perhaps be a good idea to consider this aspect.<EOL>
We can formulate a framework for a European public service.<EOL>
As rapporteur, I was in the second delegation, and I was very impressed by the number of petitioners and found not only what they said but also their trust in Europe’s response very moving.<EOL>
We all know that groups which indulge in sadistic and paedophilic practices mask their activities and hide behind other forms of identity.<EOL>
I would also like to thank all the coordinators, especially Reimer Böge of the European People' s Party and Ralf Walter of the Party of European Socialists for their constructive and pertinent cooperation.<EOL>
Mr President, the European Parliament welcomes this five-year programme.<EOL>
I work closely with Scottish local government bodies on their concerns, and was delighted that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) recently welcomed the draft EU Treaty as far as local government is concerned.<EOL>
I am certainly not, however, advocating the unlimited use of coccidiostatica.<EOL>
The important question which you raised, Mrs Spaak, must be considered in this context.<EOL>
I would be much obliged.<EOL>
Before the emergency was imposed we had witnessed some encouraging developments, with hope for a more inclusive political process and stronger democratic institutions, but regrettably this has now been put in question and today we ask ourselves whether this situation is still reversible or whether it is not too late to restore confidence and conditions in advance of the parliamentary elections.<EOL>
The impression has been given that Parliament is being bypassed and that the decision will be taken solely by the European Council at the Commission’s proposal.<EOL>
We have proposed to provide research with competitive financing, adequate infrastructures and intellectual property regulations, as well as efficient mobility for researchers in our desire for the European Union to be a top international research partner.<EOL>
Now we have obtained new and positive results from research into peat's effect on climate, with reference to the lifecycle model.<EOL>
I should have pressed 'plus'.<EOL>
I apologise, but all this was due to the technical error.<EOL>
We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year.<EOL>
The dangers that arise from the relationship are ones which have been quite rightly drawn attention to by Mrs Mann in particular.<EOL>
As an English Conservative I have great respect for our French Socialist President of the Committee on Culture; I admire the first quality, I will excuse the second!<EOL>
Since the last World Forum, the role of local authorities has been recognised by all the stakeholders, including members of Parliament and ministers.<EOL>
Presidency, it is good to see you here.<EOL>
I am aware of the various studies carried out on the number of jobs that could be created.<EOL>
Accordingly, I ask all my fellow Members to act responsibly and in such a way that we may, with a large majority, be able to give an opinion to the Council on this much-disputed question.<EOL>
What people want is information, Commissioner, and you should therefore be more open in your dealings with this House.<EOL>
We cannot confine ourselves to constantly calling for stability.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
The Spanish Presidency should cope with the two main contradictions of the European Union: the contradiction between pan-European needs and European national egoists, and the contradiction between the level of development in the western territories of the Union and that in the eastern territories, with their consequences in terms of political sensitivity.<EOL>
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.<EOL>
I will not go into that now.<EOL>
As such, it is not relevant to speculate about deferring their accession.<EOL>
Eighthly, support for the European Commission in research and development in the small ruminant industry, concentrating on both technical innovation for farms and product innovation.<EOL>
Thank you, Commissioner.<EOL>
The basis for this should be the study carried out by the Wise Persons Group.<EOL>
As far as police violence is concerned, the only thing the report has to say is that a disproportionate use of force should be avoided and it sits firmly on the fence as regards the conduct of the demonstrators and that of the police forces.<EOL>
I should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen Member States.<EOL>
Thirdly, both Mexico and Brazil are strongly committed to global issues that we can only, in fact, tackle jointly.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
The Commission remains of the view that full ownership unbundling is the best way forward, but we have continued to make clear that we are ready to consider alternatives that are the functional equivalent of that.<EOL>
The report contains valuable proposals on what has to be done in order to make more efficient and effective use of natural resources, in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and save energy.<EOL>
In this report we also urge governments and national parliaments to take effective measures to prevent drugs entering prisons.<EOL>
I think the timetable that will now be adopted is too slow from the point of view of climate change, especially as there has been a dramatic increase in the use of air conditioning in vehicles in recent years.<EOL>
The decision was taken to set up geological storage for fifty years.<EOL>
I say this because I find it rather difficult to understand why a report that addresses the issue of poverty makes no reference to rising food prices.<EOL>
With regard to voluntary and unpaid donations, Article 19 of the common position lays down a number of specific provisions, including, in particular (Paragraph 1) that Member States are to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations and ensure that blood is in so far as possible provided from such donations.<EOL>
This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely.<EOL>
Finally, it needs to be emphasised that we are approaching a decisive stage of the legislative process, and time is becoming a major factor.<EOL>
I would be pleased if, for this area in particular, the European Commission would consider how we could set up some kind of market access programme, not only for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also for agriculture in the countries that will profit from the Free Trade Agreement.<EOL>
We have seen recently in the former Yugoslavia, and now in Chechnya, the terrible effects of armed conflict and we see, furthermore, the effect of governments' efforts to suppress independent media comment on such conflicts, and the development towards totalitarian government.<EOL>
I hope that they will take the right decision.<EOL>
These democratic movements fighting for civil rights showed the world that the Polish and Hungarian nations' love of freedom cannot be suppressed, and that it could not be suppressed even by Soviet tanks and Communist collaborators.<EOL>
We tried, but it was not possible because of the opposition of certain Member States which are now probably hiding behind so-called social amendments.<EOL>
It was therefore necessary to take strong measures to protect public health and also, not least, to restore confidence.<EOL>
It is also a matter of agreeing on and standardising consumer rights and other legislation making up the It is a very important matter and, once again, I would like to express my regret that we are discussing it so late.<EOL>
The Council would then be able to decide under the German Presidency whether or not to include Slovakia in the first group.<EOL>
We would be terrible hypocrites to take up the fight against discrimination, racism, and xenophobia as a founding principle of the European Community and then, in our normal procedure, to implement exclusion policies which heighten the fears of European citizens of being contaminated by people who are different to us.<EOL>
Madam President, coherent action is urgently required at local, national and European levels to clean up our land, sea and air.<EOL>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that, setting aside the political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire, we are facing a genuine humanitarian crisis that may well linger on.<EOL>
It is also in favour of financial transparency and includes non-confessional reference to Christian values and human rights.<EOL>
No, of course not.<EOL>
How serious are we about implementing it and how efficiently do we want to promote it?<EOL>
Concerning research potential activities, the addition of the reference to the associated countries clarifies and emphasises the eligibility of entities from these countries to participate in the actions supported under this specific programme.<EOL>
Does that apply to other public sector organisations?<EOL>
On seeing these pictures, everyone wondered what freedom Rugova enjoyed, while 'protected' by the Serb police, in a country that has been emptied of its inhabitants.<EOL>
On a more personal note, I would also like to congratulate you on being the first woman to lead this House in a long time.<EOL>
This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights.<EOL>
I would also like to urge the Commission to make greater endeavours to simplify the regional policy implementation rules and to ensure clearer distribution of responsibilities and competences between all those involved in cohesion policy.<EOL>
I want to say that the final EU reaction was far from clear.<EOL>
Georgia deserves to receive our support.<EOL>
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.<EOL>
   Mr President, Police Officers Michaelis and Proske claim that our fellow Member Mr Pflüger used the word ‘shithead’, or ‘’, in connection with a demonstration in Munich.<EOL>
I would like to point out that it will never be possible to bring this subject to a close.<EOL>
Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20.<EOL>
This has understandably led to rancour, especially in Russia.<EOL>
If those two things were done then we might be able to make progress.<EOL>
It is something I am concerned about and am seeking to address by making sure that there are clear guidelines, as you suggest, so you and I are fully in agreement on that point.<EOL>
Europe has helped define our place in the wider world.<EOL>
Saying this does not in any way correspond to an idea of security or a concern for defence conceived as an alternative to our alliances, not least our alliance with the United States.<EOL>
The measures proposed are a step in the right direction, and I have voted for the report.<EOL>
Therefore, these conclusions will have a long-term effect on every individual.<EOL>
We never tire of repeating – as I have done several times here in Parliament – that in thinking about and working at improving security we have to maintain a firm, practical balance between investigation requirements – the right to investigate and to repress very serious crimes – on the one hand, and other fundamental rights on the other.<EOL>
Shipping is the most efficient and environmentally-friendly mode of transport, while aviation is more or less the worst.<EOL>
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.<EOL>
Let us simply note that fact and continue the debate.<EOL>
Last, but by no means least, we are a Community of 500 million people.<EOL>
In none of these armed conflicts did the European Union, as an international actor, play a part in deciding the course of events.<EOL>
The return of the proceeds of crime, the procedure required, and cooperation in telecommunications traffic between Member States - a very difficult topic - are described.<EOL>
The individual is important: private investors rather than institutions make up nearly half the transactions of the Nasdaq.<EOL>
That being said, and to respond to the concerns that have been expressed both by several Members of Parliament and by some of our Member States, as well as by some traders and, obviously, by the countries in question, the Commission has agreed to show a degree of flexibility.<EOL>
In areas within our political responsibility, we have to create the conditions for effective actions on the ground, serving both society and people living with HIV and AIDS.<EOL>
I am particularly pleased that the proposal on behalf of the Committee on International Trade is a considerable improvement on the original document, notably in relation to how to include developing countries in the world trade system, and the importance to be attached to the liberalisation of certain non-essential services and, importantly, to the solutions being proposed to reduce agricultural protection.<EOL>
The second point is a strong emphasis on a wide range of approaches with regard to the need for prevention and for users and local services to be actively involved at all levels in the global strategy, and even more so in the area of prevention.<EOL>
If ever small businesses needed something, it is the reduction of administrative burdens.<EOL>
The possibility also opens up of building transport equipment that will use less energy.<EOL>
For many years, the European Court of Human Rights has fulfilled its role very well, defending the weak and the persecuted.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mantovani and I would like to express the Commission's thanks to him and to the responsible committees for their proactive engagement and supportive stance throughout the negotiations on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning.<EOL>
But one thing should be quite clear: this says less about the government's attitude to reform than about the stubborn resistance of conservatives.<EOL>
It is therefore quite incomprehensible and utterly deplorable that the foreign ministers of the European Union have now taken the decision simply to abandon the criteria and political conditions that they themselves imposed and agree to Burma’s participation in ASEM summits without their being complied with.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
The Council would like to request the Commission to state the anticipated surplus for 2002 so that this can be factored into the 2003 budget via a letter of amendment.<EOL>
This will help drive down costs for consumers and boost business for small and medium enterprises.<EOL>
Like you, we are keen for everything to fall into place as quickly as possible, with regard to both the posts that are to be filled and the list of commissioners that is to be presented to the European Parliament for the hearing that you are to hold.<EOL>
Mr President, with reference to Mr Frassoni' s intervention, we sent a letter to President Fontaine this morning. We, too, would like to know how Mr Berlusconi, who is tied up in an electoral campaign in Italy, came to be included on the attendance list; we would like to know the identity of the joker who played this trick, which is in appallingly bad taste, or whether there is something going on which has nothing to do with politics.<EOL>
I hope that we will not have to deal with this now and I hope that I will not, when I return to my own country, have to admit at some future referendum on the Constitutional Treaty that we in this Parliament do get involved in details, which should be left to the man and woman in the street.<EOL>
The first is that the European Union has absolutely no competence over energy, so much so that the various reports all stress that the Member States still have exclusive powers to make their own energy choices.<EOL>
By way of example, based on a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee of 18 December 1998 on the coordinated use of consultants in respect of documents, measures are being introduced which are intended to combat illegal migration by air and sea in cooperation with various African countries.<EOL>
The first of those problems arises because the multinational protection force is to begin demobilizing in mid-July and withdraw completely by the end of August, by which time it is highly likely that Albania will still not have its own adequate system of internal controls.<EOL>
And thirdly, we help to implement the agreements that have been concluded, as and when this occurs.<EOL>
The flexibility that is essential if we are to reach, and I hope exceed, the 20% target together is provided by genuine cooperation mechanisms.<EOL>
That has made for a lack of ambiguity in our relations with Turkey, and the accession partnerships that we have developed as instruments of cooperation have proved their worth remarkably well in the endeavour to advance the reform process.<EOL>
The result was that the Commission made a new proposal to us which was very similar to its first proposal, to which we again gave an essentially positive assessment in Parliament, and which then, because of the change of legal base - Maastricht gave way to Amsterdam - had to be recast in a new proposal, which is now on the table here and which we must once again debate.<EOL>
What we are saying is that in real time, during the actual flight, there should be this integration and harmonisation of systems which increases control.<EOL>
Might the President-in-Office and his successors be able to help with this in future?<EOL>
There are currently 13.6 million citizens in EU Member States employed directly in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors, with an additional 5 million people working in the agri-food industry.<EOL>
It goes without saying that for this service to be able to start operating, the prospective High Representative must submit here in our Parliament his or her proposal for setting up the service.<EOL>
This protection is urgent and necessary, when we bear in mind the type of illicit material which has begun to circulate widely on international networks.<EOL>
I believe we are not quite there yet.<EOL>
Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has an essential role to play in terms of defining the balance between liberty and security in the fight against terrorism.<EOL>
However, we shall take account of your request.<EOL>
Even though the Langen report dealt with procurement inside the European Union, it became quite obvious, even to those who were less inclined to listen, that the global environment is as important to business in the EU as the internal regulation.<EOL>
Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution.<EOL>
The migration debate is completely polarised in many Member States.<EOL>
Moreover, we need to be better at following up a number of the decisions we take.<EOL>
We also have not had the relevant legal instruments which would make it possible to set up a suitable partnership with participants from various states which is, in fact, the key to success in this area.<EOL>
Such measures should end the crisis as regards the euro and Greece.<EOL>
I urge you to make the right choice.<EOL>
I support the United Nations investigation into the issue of Western Sahara, and its position that Morocco should allow journalists, independent observers and humanitarian organisations free access to this particular region.<EOL>
The eco-label regulation treads the fine line between economic and ecological interests, one group wanting above all to enforce stringent environmental requirements, the other with an eye on the marketing aspect of the label.<EOL>
However, the declared intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact (SDP), which prohibits Member States' public expenditure from overshooting a budget deficit of 3% of GDP.<EOL>
Individual Member States must design their curricula according to national circumstances.<EOL>
I myself endorse the recommendations made by our rapporteur, especially with respect to the reform of the Structural Funds.<EOL>
<EOL>
I have the feeling that if I were now to show this Commission proposal to Japanese and American industry, it would produce the reaction 'no wonder you will never manage to establish a proper industry for the environment.'<EOL>
This could give rise to civil unrest, something we should be endeavouring to prevent in Europe.<EOL>
Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people are expected to be in Kiev tomorrow.<EOL>
I feel it is worth mentioning that, within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, one of the aims of restrictive measures remains the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.<EOL>
This would strengthen the role of the Ombudsman and these agencies could serve to refer matters which the Ombudsman services in the Member States are authorized to deal with, and vice versa.<EOL>
The Irish Presidency is working in a way that instils much confidence in this House, and I wish it every success.<EOL>
It is indeed a disgraceful matter that not one indictee has been transferred by the Republika Srpska to The Hague, although there are reports today that some war crime suspects have been arrested by Republika Srpska for trial locally.<EOL>
It appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to Europe and to our children.<EOL>
The written notification to the Commission is under way.<EOL>
That is what matters at the present moment.<EOL>
There is a lot of talk about them at the moment, but they are not really known.<EOL>
There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems, but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems.<EOL>
If the European Union wants to extend its jurisdiction into this field it ought first to secure the wholehearted consent of the people for the legal basis on which it intends to do so.<EOL>
Reading about the scandal in the press, I have learned that two influential Members of the European Parliament are involved in this scandal.<EOL>
Neither have I had an acknowledgement from the President of the existing committee, nor have I had an acknowledgement of my request from the President of the European Commission.<EOL>
Therefore, Mr President: 'European Union all over the world!'<EOL>
I would prefer that we had a science-based approach to animal welfare rather than one driven by emotion.<EOL>
Because underlying the concept of racism and xenophobia there are people and their destinies, and they should not be used to put on some kind of political show.<EOL>
. I have voted for the Schmid report because I believe it supports and makes a contribution to the achievement of the three main goals of the 'European Employment Strategy', namely full employment, increased productivity and greater social inclusion within society of marginalised and disadvantaged groups.<EOL>
I think that this report is extremely important for the economic development of the European Union.<EOL>
An International Criminal Court was set up in Rome.<EOL>
We are now in the run-up to the final negotiations and the final ministerial meetings were held on 20 May, and the European Council on 23 May, and at this moment in time we are constantly in negotiations.<EOL>
The bad news is that the net contributors are still continuing to place restrictions on the Union’s development by means of spending cuts.<EOL>
What, then, was I trying to do?<EOL>
Does the Finnish Presidency intend to propose such structures of direct participation of citizens in such decisions?<EOL>
We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets.<EOL>
We have got to be responsible, and we have got to be responsible as a Parliament as we move towards the legal text that the Commissioner will bring forward in the late autumn of this year.<EOL>
Also, an amendment has been added - Amendment No 3 - which calls for the potato problem to be analysed as a whole, including potatoes for consumption, because we need a COM to regulate the European potato market, in order to protect farmers from the price drops which regularly affect this product.<EOL>
I regret that the Commissioner did not indicate any such proposals rather than seek to justify the existing system.<EOL>
Import figures for the first months of 2005 show that Chinese exporters have availed themselves of the opportunities offered by the elimination of quotas.<EOL>
Madam President, the Minister began her speech by talking about her generation.<EOL>
However, the evidence of danger to the fish stocks caused by Russian disregard for agreements has been accumulating.<EOL>
He has neglected to ensure that we speak about the peacebuilding partnership or the development of a civilian peace corps.<EOL>
It has tackled secret agreements and abuses of dominant positions and has also controlled mergers and State subsidies.<EOL>
The Council has set total administrative appropriations for all institutions, European Parliament and mediators included, at ECU 4, 301 million, an increase of ECU 18 million, or 0.42 % above the funding agreed in 1997.<EOL>
I can equally assure you that I remain personally committed to this issue and will continue to work on it until the end of my mandate with the same energy and vigour that I have devoted to it thus far, and of course with the kind help and support of Parliament.<EOL>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - The first results of the product safety stocktaking were released on 22 November 2007.<EOL>
(SL) Italy wishes to impose an onshore gas terminal on the border with Slovenia without consultation.<EOL>
Thus I feel that the main challenge now is to control migratory flows, structure them in accordance with real needs, and ensure higher levels of integration of these people in the host countries, as well as stepping up surveillance of our borders, with policies that provide for repatriation to the countries of origin.<EOL>
The promotion of high labour standards, social standards and corporate social responsibility represents an extremely large challenge for the external dimension of social policy.<EOL>
Secondly we can fight international terrorism only on the basis of trust between the USA and Europe, trust that was damaged through both sides apportioning blame and must be re-established.<EOL>
We are also very concerned that we are now seeing an increase of Libyans fleeing the country.<EOL>
There will be winners and losers and if we do not want to belong to the losers' group, we must set out a clear and ambitious strategy.<EOL>
In any case the need now for internal clarification is strong, and in this regard we welcome the Presidency initiative calling for an extraordinary summit next Monday, in an attempt to get Europe to speak with one voice, defining the European position in view of the most recent events.<EOL>
So I think we need to put an end to this hypocrisy.<EOL>
The Commission has therefore no legal basis for intervention in the matter of supplementary charges on cross-border payment services in the UK and Ireland.<EOL>
I see this as another indispensable step towards the goal of a truly competitive intermodal transport chain.<EOL>
Closer cooperation leads to increased contact and relationships between individuals, institutions and companies.<EOL>
The next item is the report (A4-0495/98) by Mr Camisón Asensio, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 70/221/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to liquid-fuel tanks and rear underrun protection of motor vehicles and their trailers (COM(98)0097 - C4-0257/98-98/0071(COD)).<EOL>
Quite aside from the specific circumstances that you mention, the Euratom Treaty specified safeguards of nuclear materials used for civil use in the European Union, in other words, all the measures that enable us to verify that nuclear materials and equipment are not used for anything other than the peaceful purposes for which they are intended.<EOL>
Some Member States of the European Union felt that it would be desirable for a common position to be submitted to the Court.<EOL>
Just as we are opposed to a standard European regulation governing air quality, which is a local problem, so we think it worth harmonising fuel specifications, since the refiners' markets extend way beyond national borders.<EOL>
The report complains that non-EU countries produce food to very different production standards, thereby exposing EU agricultural products to unequal terms of competition.<EOL>
Forgive my outburst of emotion, but missiles have also fallen on Bulgaria ... there have been many mistakes and we cannot simply say we are sorry.<EOL>
The next item is the report (A5-0184/2001) by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common agricultural policy (CAP): direct support schemes (amending Regulation 1259/1999/EC) (COM(2000) 841 - C5-0762/2000 - 2000/0335(CNS)).<EOL>
The proposal for a directive is based on a compromise between the airports and airlines, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other.<EOL>
The ambition was to immediately extend cover and protection to everyone who gets on board a ship, whether in international waters, national waters or on rivers.<EOL>
We must support the efforts that have been made, both by the Algerian authorities - notably those put into action by President Zéroual, whose electoral legitimacy is beyond question - and by the different political groups who participated in the last elections in order to re-establish a normal functioning of the democratic institutions.<EOL>
Parliament requested this a few years ago and the Commission is now meeting this request.<EOL>
Or would you just continue pressing for it?<EOL>
   Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Bösch on the report and express my appreciation of the firm stance he took towards those directly and politically responsible for the fraud who have been charged.<EOL>
A coach party came to visit Parliament in Strasbourg.<EOL>
All in all, this action is a very good thing, which, in both this context and that of our previous debate on citizenship, helps the public to see Europe’s great cultural diversity.<EOL>
1.<EOL>
The EU ought to provide consequent aid to Greece as soon as possible, and seriously improve its capacities and means in terms of civil protection and emergency action.<EOL>
It is quite simply based on our common reference framework in the field of development policy, on the European Consensus that the European Parliament and the Commission approved scarcely a year and a half ago.<EOL>
It is a major step forward that it is now openly being admitted that an EU Member State has been working with the United States, Australia and New Zealand on worldwide espionage for a long time, something which may well adversely affect people, organisations and businesses within the EU.<EOL>
Mr President, during the discussion in this Chamber one of the suggestions made is that we, if we name sectors in which we wish to pursue a development policy, should at the same time as it were, impose conditions on colleagues in other countries in the South.<EOL>
Since then, new and important players have entered the world stage and are giving us cause to reflect anew on the contribution that Europe can make to this global world and where its true competitive advantages lie.<EOL>
We have, meanwhile, had the opportunity of talking to the Commissioner about this.<EOL>
It is essential that the same method is not used again in the future.<EOL>
Of course we need supervisory structures with real regulatory bite, but so too do we need counter-cyclical measures to deal with the realities of recession.<EOL>
Yet again, we see that it is the prospect of European integration and membership of the European Union that is the most powerful force driving forward the process of political and economic reform in a country which, until recently, was being torn apart by war, civil war and violence.<EOL>
In the view of my group it is not.<EOL>
Since the report sums up in detail the necessary steps, I would only like to address the question of what the European Union needs to do in order to be able to offer effective and very rapid assistance to human rights defenders who need it.<EOL>
I am therefore very surprised at this omission and would ask that my presence on Friday, 12 February be recorded.<EOL>
It was Mr Bangemann who, in this way, secured the Danish 'no' to the Maastricht Treaty on 2 June 1992, which put the skids under the process which we call the democratisation process.<EOL>
No one can deny this, much less so the Partido Popular or the Spanish Government.<EOL>
I am also pleased that the Dalai reaffirmed before this House last December his devotion to the middle-way approach and to dialogue as the only means for achieving a mutually acceptable and lasting solution.<EOL>
Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Diamantopoulou and I fully support her last statement to the effect that the purpose of the report is not just to balance accounts but to ensure that the elderly are able to lead dignified lives, which is the most important thing.<EOL>
The ECI in theory is a sound concept, yet my enthusiasm is tempered with the fact that the Commission still holds considerable power.<EOL>
I therefore reject this report.<EOL>
Back in the year 2000, the Czech Government adopted a national plan to combat the commercial sexual abuse of children and in 2003 a wide-ranging national plan to combat the trade in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation.<EOL>
So, Madam President, I believe the best way of paying a tribute of admiration and respect to the memory of Bishop Gerardi and the ideals for which he laid down his life is for the European Union to continue in its efforts - and now I am addressing the Commission and its representative here, Mr Marín - to carry on making all possible efforts to support the Guatemalan peace process, as it always has done.<EOL>
My second point is that we should still bear in mind that the European automobile industry leads the world - we are exporters, those who are producing the cars - and, in this light, we should bear in mind the need for maintaining the long-term effectiveness, as well as the competitiveness of this industry.<EOL>
Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights has obviously taken an interest in this report and thanks the rapporteur for having accepted a large number of its proposed amendments.<EOL>
Pity the consumer who will eat GMOs without knowing it, whom we will quite deliberately be misleading.<EOL>
In spite of my basic standpoint, I believe that the Commission and Mr van Dam have both succeeded in striking an extraordinarily important balance in this matter.<EOL>
We need this legally binding Code of Conduct at last.<EOL>
Against this background, the European People's Party will tomorrow vote for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs, with the purely technical Amendment No 12 which was submitted by the Group to the House.<EOL>
That is why I think that we do not need to wait for a never-ending story to unfold to analyse the risks but to unite and promote a balanced solution. The most important thing is to reconcile the immediate safety of our citizens from fire risks with the longer-term benefits for public health and the environment.<EOL>
This is particularly true where the operator is a multinational group that has the resources to evade them and the competent authority usually gives in to its demands, as we saw in France with TotalFinaElf (Erika oil slick, explosion at the AZF factory).<EOL>
Approval of the minutes of the previous sittings: see Minutes<EOL>
The demise of farming in recent years shows this more clearly than ever.<EOL>
One of the major risks is that this will degenerate into a routine, that no one will take us seriously any more and that the results which we present will not be taken seriously either.<EOL>
We should not speak of a financial crisis in Russia, however.<EOL>
In addition, dictators always fight against the opposition that wants to have democracy.<EOL>
On the other hand, we were continuously in touch with countries that expressed doubts about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.<EOL>
Mr Ferber, there is no provision for Members to answer one another.<EOL>
They require long working periods without proper rest and they provide completely inadequate medical attention.<EOL>
Rather, it is the best possible result today, as it fills a void and opens the way for further developments.<EOL>
It is the international research community, businesses and the national institutions that are best placed to experiment and compete in the field of nanotechnologies, and it is private and state organisations within the nation states that are best placed to produce information material about nanotechnologies in keeping with the values and experiences of their own peoples.<EOL>
There are already resale rights in California, and efforts are in fact being made in the USA to introduce them throughout the country.<EOL>
While the Commission's proposal poses serious problems in terms of rigour, we must acknowledge that the draft report, despite the efforts of Mr Maat, represents little more than ‘every man for himself’.<EOL>
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.<EOL>
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has already been petitioned several times to rule, in specific cases, on whether a sporting activity is a service of purely social benefit or if, on the contrary, it also encompasses economic aspects which imply that it is a service of general economic interest.<EOL>
That is not possible.<EOL>
We, therefore, urge the Commission to come forward with practical proposals for facilitating EU citizens' full rights to the free movement of goods, in particular concerning the tax regimes for Internet and cross-border shopping.<EOL>
No such amounts of aid are paid for sheep or pigs.<EOL>
in writing. - According to Eurostat data, Croatian GDP per capita stands at 53 per cent of the EU average.<EOL>
I would like you to be aware that all Eurocontrol does is coordinate flights a priori.<EOL>
The matter is accordingly referred back for reconsideration to the committee responsible.<EOL>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, on 1 January Romania will join the European Union.<EOL>
Take Belarus, for example, where the idea of a common approach is simply absurd.<EOL>
The ice cover has already shrunk by half.<EOL>
Have old objectives been confirmed?<EOL>
Recent revelations of irregularities and corruption within the Commission underscore the need for visibly tougher supervision of activities - managed by the Commission or the Member States - paid for out of Community funds.<EOL>
The risk of a repetition of the highly damaging confusion which we experienced beneath the ash cloud is real and the measures taken must institutionally safeguard the Union's ability to intervene in a coordinated and premeditated manner in this type of crisis, thereby limiting the incredible inconvenience to millions of passengers and the financial losses to carriers and tourist companies.<EOL>
In reality, the Blue Card may cause developing countries great intellectual damage.<EOL>
However, observing market rules alone is not enough.<EOL>
   Mr President, one cannot be truly surprised at the slow progress of the opening of this IGC phase.<EOL>
I acknowledge the importance of the EU’s making absolutely sure that, within the Regional Fisheries Organisations, the fleet is adapted to available resources, which will, where possible, ensure stability and renewal.<EOL>
It would appear that the accepted estimates for passenger air transport have not taken account of high-speed rail links.<EOL>
The working groups will try to deal with the proposals as quickly as possible for a decision to be taken by the Council.<EOL>
(PL) Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Oomen-Ruijten who, once again, has drafted a very comprehensive report on Turkey's progress.<EOL>
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.<EOL>
That concludes Question Time.<EOL>
It means that we can do no other than describe integration as having been hamstrung.<EOL>
We cannot accept that, in times like these, MEPs would sooner consider their own income than that of the citizens.<EOL>
Trade and economic relations with Western Balkans (short presentation)<EOL>
Pressure on those responsible has be increased.<EOL>
This is the role of EURES, a network which is intended to provide information, advice and employment services across national borders.<EOL>
The main objective of our strategy, however, has to be reciprocity of trade relations, especially for example in China, and more rigorous enforcement of international trade legislation, rather than labelling this enforcement as protectionism.<EOL>
As regards this latter point, the Friedrich report is in line with the unanimous proposal of the Governing Council.<EOL>
I am glad that this report does not infringe on Member States, but that it takes into account the principle of subsidiarity: it provides guidelines rather than mandatory rules.<EOL>
Perhaps after the World Cup we can draw up a summary, showing how the emergency calls have been responded to, from which countries of origin most of the victims come and, above all, what has been done to take care of the victims.<EOL>
Iran needs a good future, and it is to be hoped that its President will come to realise that he needs to adopt a civilised approach in his dealings with both people and states around the world.<EOL>
The cut made to Leonardo – the training programme – was from 150 000 to 36 000.<EOL>
Eighty-five per cent of the best brains go to America and Australia, put off by our bureaucracy, our bloody-mindedness and our barriers to free movement.<EOL>
Do you want to subject them to border checks?<EOL>
Today we humans have burrowed deep.<EOL>
For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply.<EOL>
protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack,<EOL>
Unfortunately the result is not what we hoped for.<EOL>
It does not mention that the food crisis is the result of current agricultural and trade policies such as the CAP and free trade, and it does not make the fair and necessary criticism of these policies or call for the change that is needed.<EOL>
This is not an attempt to ignore the Irish 'no' vote.<EOL>
There are conclusions that we have to draw from this.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
The rapporteurs, we in this House and the Council as well as the Commission have all combined our efforts and, because of that, today we have in front of us, at last, the long-awaited new regulation that will make it possible to implement Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 which is due to replace the cumbersome Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.<EOL>
The report shows very clearly that in terms of the error rate found for cohesion policy, there has been a definite reduction.<EOL>
Symbolic acts are all very well, of course, but by themselves they serve only to allay our consciences.<EOL>
Let us be honest: I do not think that Coreper is ever going to open up and I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing.<EOL>
(SL) When a murder takes place, in particular, a religiously motivated one, we naturally can do little but recoil in horror and condemn it.<EOL>
This compromise was voted on in committee, and here we find, today, that crucial points have been amended, namely the independent regulating body and the legal status of sports companies.<EOL>
Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay.<EOL>
Madam President, unfortunately, we are seeing more and more falsified medicinal products on the market in our Member States.<EOL>
We have heard widely differing interpretations from your department and the only thing that is certain at the moment is that the fleet does not know for certain what kind of measures it is going to have to submit to and nobody seems to be able to explain them clearly.<EOL>
   . I wish to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on his outstanding report on the strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the EU, to which I lend my full backing.<EOL>
I was delighted yesterday to see the Council and the Commission here continuing the support which they have always given to the Northern Ireland peace process.<EOL>
The Commission is bound by its legal obligation to translate into all official languages Community legislation and the related documents that are necessary to enable citizens, companies and other stakeholders to enjoy their rights and comply with their obligations.<EOL>
With regard to this situation, we are not looking at a black-and-white film.<EOL>
Thank you, Mr Papakyriazis.<EOL>
Specifically, I refer to paragraph 22 of the Bullmann report which deals with the question of services of general interest.<EOL>
Collecting data leads to control systems and the vessels of our trading partners, especially of our Commonwealth, could be ordered away in an EU trade war.<EOL>
The requirement should instead be that people can support themselves by working.<EOL>
In Belgium as elsewhere, love of country is fraudulently assimilated with xenophobia and xenophobia with racism.<EOL>
Madam President, lades and gentlemen, the mere mention of the idea of telephone tapping is enough to get the relevant circles talking about a police state and 'Big Brother', just like Pavlov's dogs.<EOL>
(NL) Madam President, relations between the European Union and the African countries have become unacceptably strained due to the negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries about the Economic Partnership Agreements.<EOL>
However, direct job creation is also important.<EOL>
One aspect of this report which seems tremendously important to me is the fact that it reveals that the Community, or European Union, is changing more and more from an economic community into a political and thus a security community.<EOL>
A huge resource of finance - over ECU 200 billion per year - is spent on the social security systems.<EOL>
(PL) Madam President, the Council of Europe was set up to protect human rights - which includes the right of every person to life - and to promote common fundamental values while at the same time strengthening security for the citizens of Europe, and this constitutes a denial of the right to kill.<EOL>
The problems observed when it was being discussed should now be taken into careful consideration as we debate this proposal for a directive which would create a legal framework for the establishment of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe.<EOL>
The first step, of course involves meeting accession requirements and complying with the acquis communautaire.<EOL>
There is more work to be done on it, so that what we have set ourselves we may actually bring to pass.<EOL>
   Mr President, the Spanish Government's mistaken policy is flooding the Union with people without documents.<EOL>
Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort.<EOL>
(NL) Madam President, it is a cliché, but young people are our future, and so I would be the first to admit that the quality of our instructors and of teacher education is extremely important.<EOL>
It was reported that Hungary has imposed a caged bed ban that will come fully into force at the beginning of 2005.<EOL>
The time has come to combat stereotypes that have taken root in society.<EOL>
We need integrated strategies and much more in-depth studies and research into the problems we are facing.<EOL>
The aim of the present draft is to consolidate that legislation on the basis of subsequent experience.<EOL>
   – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to convey the grateful thanks of the entire political world, as a representative of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, and of its entire people for your positive contribution, so that my country could become part of enlarged Europe.<EOL>
In any EU Member State, a governor would have had to step down for that.<EOL>
If we insist on democracy in this process – not just in word but in reality – then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept.<EOL>
The summit that was supposed to be held in November 2010 has been postponed indefinitely.<EOL>
We voted in favour of the condemnatory paragraphs and of the measures to assist women who are forced to flee from countries where women are the victims of systematic barbarism.<EOL>
The law on minorities is an example to others.<EOL>
It should remain flexible and differentiated. It should make life easier for Member States on the international stage, by helping them to limit immigration and to fight, within the WTO negotiations, to enable us to retain our security and the identity of our societies.<EOL>
I should simply like to say to them that the Presidency and the whole of Parliament are, of course, extremely concerned by what is happening.<EOL>
When saying that there are positive ethnic changes in Serbia, I wonder whether you are aware of the fact that members of a European nation, namely of the Hungarian nation are persecuted and assaulted only because they speak Hungarian, while the police refuses to record their complaints, there are more and more judges of a doubtful reputation from Kosovo and Krajina in the region, and now there are murders ...<EOL>
The last budget in this parliamentary term is a real masterpiece.<EOL>
As a result, it not only fails to propose reforestation measures, but also emphasises that 'an increase in forest cover' should be undertaken only 'where it is absolutely vital'.<EOL>
Yes, some may still pollute their aquifers, but some have been polluting them for some time, for example with huge pig farms.<EOL>
Advice, the provision of information and prevention naturally remain key, but I nevertheless think that it is also extremely important for the government to try to make nightlife a little safer.<EOL>
Of course, in keeping with what you have said, we condemn all acts of terror.<EOL>
So we are engaged in a genuine race against time.<EOL>
Sri Lanka (debate)<EOL>
I should perhaps point out again that using mobile phones in the Chamber is not allowed.<EOL>
How can we Europeans have confidence in your will to implement the European Digital Agenda when you have just halved the budget for research.<EOL>
(CS) Thank you, Madam President, I have just one brief remark on the whole complex subject of the textile industry and the impact of globalisation on it.<EOL>
I would like to say to Mr Pasty that I find him very optimistic.<EOL>
So I believe that with the Safer Internet programme we have to empower the children themselves, beyond empowering the parents and the educators.<EOL>
At its meeting on 14 April, the Council approved the following conclusions:<EOL>
Africa and the EU understand that there is a need to raise their relations to a new level, with the summit representing the moment when this common desire became clear and unequivocal.<EOL>
As you well know, under Community legislation, every request for asylum or residence must be examined in the Member State first entered by the applicant, regardless of his or her actual destination.<EOL>
We should have had a longer debate.<EOL>
It seems to me that there is not only a physical blockade of the Gaza strip, there is also a political blockade in Jerusalem, because those in Jerusalem have once again completely misjudged the relationship between short-term military success and long-term political damage.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - The honourable Member seems to suggest that having an independent monetary policy in Greece would be a way of alleviating the crisis affecting the country.<EOL>
They set great store by the environment.<EOL>
The strategy addresses four challenges in particular: ensuring a sustainable environment, increasing wealth, improving accessibility and attractiveness, and guaranteeing security and certainty in the area.<EOL>
I want my good wishes to convey this message as well, in the hope that the United Kingdom will carry out a constructive role in this six months of presidency.<EOL>
To this end, Europe must hold constant and open dialogue with the whole of the Arab world.<EOL>
Since then we have found out that the war in Iraq was based on a lie and, to use an expression which has been used a lot, do not forget the Ten Commandments.<EOL>
The Santer Commission was forced to resign following suspicions of fraud which I will not go into again.<EOL>
On 19 August 2003 the UN Special Representative to Iraq, Mr Sergio de Mello, died together with UN personnel, Iraqi civilians and workers from other humanitarian aid and bilateral organisations attending a coordination meeting in the UN building at that time, on that day.<EOL>
The first is that, at Maastricht, the European Council, in its wisdom, instructed the Court of Auditors to produce this certificate of assurance - the DAS.<EOL>
The Member States can be tougher in the action they take.<EOL>
We believe that the Council should first carry out the task which it is assigned in the Treaty of scrutinising the documents, and that only afterwards should we discuss the results with you.<EOL>
What I said was that we need not try to fire everyone with enthusiasm about it all at once, but at the same time those of us who are actively involved must feel passionately about it, otherwise it will not work.<EOL>
We are a political House and this is a political debate on the measures to be taken by Europe to defend human rights and beat terrorism, and it is a debate that is also intended to provide lessons in democracy.<EOL>
National governments took part in the Convention’s public discussions and have rubberstamped the end result.<EOL>
Mr President, last night I dreamt of the great Greek philosopher, Socrates, whose name has been given to the Socrates programme admirably outlined by Mrs Pack.<EOL>
The next item is Question Time (B5-0001/2001).<EOL>
Therefore, I welcome the commitment to be made at Ghent to proceed with the debates on the euro, enlargement and the political integration of Europe at Laeken and through the Convention.<EOL>
   If we are to have a functioning European market for goods, it is important for the consumer’s interests too to be safeguarded.<EOL>
I also feel that the argument put forward in the debate that the institute will provide greater visibility and political transparency for the issues of equal rights and equal opportunities is correct.<EOL>
The Albanians must enable those Serbs who wish to live in their homeland in Kosovo to do so, and to return if they so wish.<EOL>
As we move ever closer to the next millennium, a time which corresponds to long-term predictions that, by the end of the 20th century, tourism would be the biggest industry in the world, will the German Presidency outline what new directions it intends to give at EU level to consolidate the strengths of the EU tourism product, particularly in relation to the peripheral regions which are dependent on tourism?<EOL>
New Zealand, for whom I have appointed myself spokesperson, is currently working on just such a system and wonders whether our contribution to this system will be medicine-centred or disease-centred and, in the latter case, whether the answers provided will revolve around medicinal therapy or whether other, replacement therapies will be proposed on these sites.<EOL>
For example, the Peace II programme is something justified in terms of its being an internal matter for the EU, while we are opposed to the EU’s being involved, as an organisation, in funding the reconstruction of Iraq.<EOL>
Announcement by the President<EOL>
Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Matthews that, following my visit to London, there was a party statement accusing me of having "crazy ideas" .<EOL>
Worse still, our actions contradict what we say.<EOL>
Will environmental and climate change considerations be part of any new WTO package?<EOL>
Not every problem in Europe is necessarily a problem for Europe.<EOL>
From car and helicopter we gained a frightening picture of the destruction in Bosnia.<EOL>
That is an important aspect of the proposal.<EOL>
Could it not also assess whether, in a given year, the Commission has indeed taken the steps necessary to ensure value for money?<EOL>
To be brief, notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text, Parliament calls for the European budget, in its total amount and distribution, to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union, as it defines them.<EOL>
Since its launch in 1997, DAPHNE has cofinanced 14 projects specifically dedicated to this issue, providing a total amount of around EUR 2.4 million.<EOL>
The suspicion that the Vietnamese guerrilla movement, which fought for the reunion of North and South, was making use of supply routes running through inhospitable parts of Cambodia was reason enough for the Americans to intervene and bring it under the control of a friendly government.<EOL>
Through his work, the Ombudsman contributes to the promotion of good administration.<EOL>
It needs to be at the forefront of our priorities, and it merits a collective response which ensures that those who find themselves in a situation of social vulnerability have a modicum of dignity.<EOL>
It is quite clear that we must agree on how to carry on with this work in the future.<EOL>
Let it be clear that I largely share the Dutch Government's view, yet, even so, I should like to make a few recommendations leading up to the European Council of 21 and 22 June.<EOL>
As far as I understood, it contains six points, and I will address them one by one.<EOL>
Minister Sasi indicated some of the things which are necessary in order to improve conditions for direct foreign investment.<EOL>
The motion for a resolution is restricted to certain essential issues.<EOL>
The main purpose of the Regulation on the mutual recognition of lawfully marketed goods is to remove non-tariff barriers, which could also be termed protectionist barriers.<EOL>
The worst by far is China with over 1 000 executions this year alone.<EOL>
A recent study by Dr Raja Mukherjee, London, claims that drinking any amount of alcohol can be damaging and that one in every 100 babies born is damaged by their mother drinking while pregnant but that many cases go unrecognised.<EOL>
According to our information, this is not the case.<EOL>
This is the case with our own forests within the European Union, and I would ask my fellow Members what Community aid was provided for European forests after they were decimated by the storm that raged last December?<EOL>
There is a need for more competition and more operators in the European air transport market, not fewer.<EOL>
The speaking time allotted to you is nothing personal.<EOL>
The European Union and this Parliament must be clear in condemning and rejecting the positions of those who carried out the coup.<EOL>
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the Commission's proposal, which amends the regulation that is currently in force, may serve to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook for people working in the country's wine industry, without damaging the interests of EU producers.<EOL>
The responsibility lies with yourselves, Minister and Commissioner.<EOL>
I should like to thank Mr van Mierlo for his philosophical and constructive speech.<EOL>
We have supported the different UN organisations very actively, and participated at the meeting of the Afghan support group in Berlin on 27 September.<EOL>
As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses.<EOL>
Unfortunately, we had to suffer a major ecological disaster in order to understand that, although the overwhelming majority of those engaged in shipping act responsibly, there are a few whose irresponsibility can have a tremendous adverse impact on the marine environment.<EOL>
The declining figures for rail transport, particularly for freight, bear witness to the lack of investment at this level.<EOL>
The proposals that were considered on that occasion relate to aid for professional training, business development, site renovation, support for communities, infrastructure aid and as part of these discussions, we hope to receive more detailed proposals on the basis for regional partnership.<EOL>
(EL) Mr President, without doubt, we need a common immigration policy and we need to reinforce our cooperation with third countries and make it more cohesive and effective.<EOL>
Despite the fact that the health service is de facto managed by the Member States, the EU can, nevertheless, act to extend health care and be, for example, an excellent platform for the exchange of good practices.<EOL>
One way is for us to offer mediation.<EOL>
Many aspects of the programmes of the various Member States, which are now to be implemented under the cover of budgetary consolidation, are specifically against women, against women's educational opportunities, against women's opportunities to make a fair and living wage, against women's opportunities to play a role in political development.<EOL>
On the other hand, the motion deplores the continuing division of the island.<EOL>
You are aware that a number of Member States remain to be convinced that setting a target against poverty is a task for our Union.<EOL>
I would like a clearer reply to my question about which model the council prefers when Sweden decides not to be part of the single currency.<EOL>
We should stand up against that as we stand up against unfairness internationally.<EOL>
As a result of some of the policies in the common fisheries policy, thousands of tonnes of edible fish are dumped dead over the sides of fishing boats around our coasts.<EOL>
The Commission has subscribed to this interpretation from the outset and considers that the solution we are working towards respects the basic structure of the Commission' s initial proposal, which is to, "define a terrorist offence on the basis of the identification of an objective factor: the terrorist act, accompanied by the identification of a subjective element: a terrorist motivation under the terms of the proposal" . This is the text currently under consideration by the Council.<EOL>
However, we can shape globalisation, even harness its dynamic potential for renewal and, indeed, for innovation in Europe.<EOL>
All in all, I am keeping it low-key. This is not a story with a happy ending, but we accept the compromise because the best is the enemy of the good.<EOL>
Before the vote:<EOL>
I listened carefully to the speech made by the representative of the Council, and it is to her that I would like to address a few brief comments.<EOL>
Mr Prodi, if it was your intention to stir up a discussion about a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, then you can count on my support.<EOL>
   Thank you, Mr President, the name is the European Union.<EOL>
To be perfectly frank, we have really initiated a form of cooperation based on trust.<EOL>
Tax-free sales will not turn the single market upside-down.<EOL>
The Commission should therefore act as an ice-breaker.<EOL>
The EU is also stepping up its dialogue with the relevant interlocutors, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.<EOL>
We cannot just think about the here and now, or future elections; we have to think about the interests of future generations.<EOL>
That will hardly be the case for regional airlines.<EOL>
So the next question is No 13.<EOL>
We need to be faster in this regard in general.<EOL>
Both aspects - health at work and working times - are clearly linked, and all of this is aimed at a more just society governed by the respect for the individual and collective rights of workers.<EOL>
Its ongoing results should keep the negotiations on track towards genuine sustainable development.<EOL>
Paradoxically, the low noise level, which might be considered an advantage, can be a real hazard for children and the elderly and, in particular, for blind people.<EOL>
Other countries, including the EU's major trading partners, have followed the EU's example and brought in similar legislation.<EOL>
We must begin by acknowledging the fact that, if we want to promote the work of the Union and make it truly efficient, we should enter soon into a debate on the Union' s resources and the Community' s budgetary weight.<EOL>
I think that it is right for us to be informed as to what really happened.<EOL>
I saw families living in caves, the walls running with water, and listened to the hacking coughs of children racked with fever.<EOL>
EU strategy on Roma (debate)<EOL>
However, with regard to the specific observation you made about the Spinelli report and the leadership of the European Parliament, I will be happy to mark that day by making a declaration on behalf of this House, in line with your preference and your suggestion to the Conference of Presidents.<EOL>
As Mr Garot says in his report, there is a danger of this being undermined if the Member States are to cofinance it.<EOL>
In the current economic crisis, the EU must commit itself politically and financially in the key areas of maintaining and developing 'clean' technologies for combating climate change, supporting cross-border adaptation measures, boosting energy efficiency and providing assistance in the event of disasters, according to the EU's principle of solidarity.<EOL>
I am under the impression, Mrs Schleicher, Mr Lannoye, ladies and gentlemen, that this problem is like the one concerning Article 43 or Article 100a.<EOL>
One does not exclude the other.<EOL>
The Europe 2020 Strategy is revealing its true agenda.<EOL>
The Netherlands presidency is very much looking forward to hosting the forthcoming summit in The Hague on 8 November.<EOL>
I would ask the two Commissioners, in particular, namely Messrs Dimas and Verheugen - who are more acutely aware than others that the organisation of REACH tends to put small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage - to work together with SMEs on implementation in a spirit of partnership, and also to ensure that the European economy can withstand this strain.<EOL>
This is a scandal, not only for the Americans, whom it seems really do need to be taken in hand in this respect, but above all for the EU Member States, who have not prescribed any technical environmental conditions.<EOL>
Anything that will reinforce relations with Latin America, augment the content of these relations, increase the European presence and guarantee the quality and quantity of our political, economic, financial, trade and cultural relations must become quite natural for the European Union, mindful of the historical and cultural links for some and the economic and trade links for others.<EOL>
That is a no to increased supranationality, more power to the larger EU countries, a no to new steps towards a European State and EU militarisation.<EOL>
Please make allowance, then, for our requests for a whole series of split votes.<EOL>
Thank you very much.<EOL>
This relates to the provision of resources for which we are 50 % dependent and if we simply had to buy 50 % of the fish which is needed for our consumption, we would pay anyway.<EOL>
Ideologically they are promoting capitalism as the only 'democratic system'.<EOL>
Mrs Randzio-Plath, I can only shake my head at that.<EOL>
I do not want to question the sustainable combination within the waste hierarchy at all, but we must subject this waste hierarchy to a certain degree of transparency and flexibility since prevention, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and environment-friendly waste disposal are the tried and completely trusted instruments.<EOL>
In the United Kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions.<EOL>
Therefore, I will repeat it.<EOL>
However, let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States.<EOL>
No court, no judge, no power can take the life of a human being.<EOL>
We must look very carefully at road traffic because emissions in this area are continuing to increase very considerably.<EOL>
However, looking at what has been proposed, we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management, which everybody should welcome.<EOL>
I am also pleased that other European organisations, such as the Council of Europe, in the building next to ours, is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Roma.<EOL>
I am also concerned about the new, simplified procedures which make it easier to release or market certain GMOs.<EOL>
I therefore rejected the report.<EOL>
I would like to particularly thank Dr Liese for his excellent work and results.<EOL>
Mr President, I would now like to talk about the proposed changes, most of which are separate from the question of controls and relate to the general problem of duty-free sales.<EOL>
It was also emphasised at the European Council that the Union' s development of a crisis control capability would improve its position when involved in the furtherance of world peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.<EOL>
To increase the effectiveness of the report and with a view to the protection of citizens' privacy, in particular, as well as companies, may I suggest to Mr Schmid, once again, and to the Members that they include some amendments tabled by Mr Di Lello and others, specifically Amendments Nos 12, 20, 21, 22 and 30.<EOL>
These are concepts that form part of the ideological heritage of the European Union - one need only think of Delors - since we have often acknowledged the social economy as the keystone of the European social model, but then done very little about it.<EOL>
I recall that the budgetary process for 2011 was the first of its kind since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and that it indisputably requires greater cooperation and coordination with the other arm of the budgetary authority.<EOL>
This is an initial first victory.<EOL>
A second point concerns estimating the level of funding.<EOL>
And that, to a large extent, explains why the current debate is experiencing such difficulties.<EOL>
Finally, we said there had to be free access for independent NGOs, free access for the UN human rights bodies and freedom of the press.<EOL>
On the question or prioritising the prevention of waste over its management, the Commission, in principle, shares your view that it is more important to prevent waste than to manage it.<EOL>
Mr President, it is appropriate I raise my point after this exchange because the greatest political excitement in the Brussels village at present is the machinations and intrigues on the fisheries policy, rather than the content of it which is of course very important.<EOL>
But what is singularly impressive at this point is the genuine desire among all the Member State governments for a real agreement to be reached.<EOL>
Even if no agreement can be reached on figures and percentages in Cancún, it is absolutely essential that the Convention states agree on concrete plans and commitments, thus preparing the way for the conclusion of a post-Kyoto Protocol in South Africa in 2011.<EOL>
We have to start testing foodstuffs, their components and the raw materials of animal and plant origin for health hazards, hygienic acceptability and biological values.<EOL>
In this connection, the Council is prepared to mediate in order to create a climate of trust among the parties and hence to facilitate a sustainable solution, but it does not intend to take the place of the United Nations.<EOL>
The concrete improvements provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the field of foreign policy and common security, which the Committee on Institutional Affairs recognizes, should of course be assessed in the light of experience.<EOL>
Doctors and nurses - both male and female - have a particular responsibility here to provide patients with objective, complete and scientifically up-to-date information in writing about all the details of their implants, such as the identification number, volume and type.<EOL>
Thank you.<EOL>
We know what it is like for the people.<EOL>
The Council has been conscious that we cannot let the whole process start again from scratch, however, as the timing is indeed important if we are to avoid the instability you mention.<EOL>
In view of this, we choose to vote against Mrs Prets’s report (A6-0017/2005) - the ‘European Capital of Culture’ event for the years 2005 to 2019.<EOL>
Commissioner Barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms, not necessarily to conclude them.<EOL>
And I will be particularly interested to find out whether the German authorities have effectively linked the provision of aid to a single bidder and, if so, to find out why they regarded that bidder's business plan as preferable from an industrial and commercial point of view.<EOL>
I believe it would not be in our interests to only give large organisations a chance to move things forward in this sphere, rather our aim must continue to be that of promoting a variety of organisational structures.<EOL>
What seems to have happened is that responsibility for the system is not clearly defined and both the EU and the individual Member States have neglected the problem to some extent.<EOL>
A quarter of a century has, in fact, gone by since another key moment in the history of the Middle East, when we were able to assume our responsibilities.<EOL>
Since 1991, Parliament has been attempting to make this more evident by grouping together all the articles of the Communities' budget referring to the promotion of human rights and democratic principles in a single budget line, B7-70.<EOL>
On Sunday, 4 August, Cecilio Gallego Alaria and a six-year-old girl were killed by a car bomb which had been placed near a bus stop in the Spanish town of Santa Pola in Alicante.<EOL>
We want initiatives to be taken with a view to combating racism, xenophobia and forms of discrimination.<EOL>
Another way would be for the Council to put it in the accession treaty but again if they were to do that unilaterally, without consensus and agreement, that would undermine the spirit of the Treaties.<EOL>
The Presidency will keep you informed about progress in the talks that are underway in the Council.<EOL>
The Central Bank has managed to fulfil its primary mission of maintaining price stability.<EOL>
I shall not dwell on what has already been said, notably as regards the extent of the huge - unfathomable, one might say - financial impact of this crisis in direct or indirect terms.<EOL>
I think that we need further discussion on three points in the report.<EOL>
The next item is the report (A5-0134/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission recommendation for the 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (drawn up pursuant to Article 99(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community).<EOL>
Lack of punctuality and flexibility mean that, directly contrary to all political intentions, freight transport by train is falling behind.<EOL>
Written statements (Rule 149)<EOL>
I would like to thank him expressly for his sensitivity to one of the most fundamental rights of human beings, the right to life, which, together with freedoms of expression and movement, is being persistently violated by ETA in an area of European territory, the Basque Country, and in Spain as a whole.<EOL>
However, we need to ensure better coordination of course, especially in the areas of research and innovation.<EOL>
I have one final question: your Veterinary Committee knows the type of vaccination needed and can guarantee its safety.<EOL>
This is sometimes a slow process, but it creates a firm basis for lasting solutions and for a viable society.<EOL>
Nor can it be the organisation that dominates all the other institutions.<EOL>
First, the Berisha regime must come to an end. The electoral process must establish a new President and a new Parliament.<EOL>
(PL) Mr President, Turkey is an important neighbour of the European Union, and the report which has been submitted for 2010 highlights significant changes which have taken place there.<EOL>
I regret the lack of a clear and convincing approach to such situations in the document under discussion.<EOL>
It is now known that Madrid and the UN were warned of the attack.<EOL>
We need consistency, patience and a well thought-out strategy for turning noble words into concrete action that leads to results.<EOL>
Community legislation is generally of a high quality and easily manages to control even the small details of human life - too small, one is tempted to say.<EOL>
Although the Commission can understand that in these cases the dissatisfaction might persist, it cannot conclude that the Finnish authorities have arbitrarily misinterpreted the rules or proceeded in a way that has been contradictory to those rules.<EOL>
When I say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development firmly rejected this proposal, I mean that it did so with only three dissenting votes, and its rejection of the draft legislation was indeed unanimous.<EOL>
All the Commission's money comes from the taxpayers of the Member States or, to be precise, the taxpayers of the 14 Member States which are net contributors.<EOL>
All Member States benefit directly or indirectly.<EOL>
In other words, in some countries participation is established through legal channels and in others by means of collective agreements.<EOL>
They only see as far as the ends of their noses.<EOL>
Nor does it shy away either from supplying weapons to Zimbabwe.<EOL>
Last Monday, a joint decision by the foreign ministers, including those of the new Member States, in fact launched this Agency, which had been decided upon in principle at the Thessaloniki Summit and which must therefore begin its work in January 2004.<EOL>
That is a good thing, but there is already a clause in the current agreement, and we are not managing to make sure it is abided by.<EOL>
We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened, but rather preserved and strengthened.<EOL>
I believe in quotas as the way to make progress along this difficult path and, above all, in the motto I started with: from words to deeds.<EOL>
But as this evolution itself contributes to unemployment, as well as to the development of a psychological climate of depression, demand has remained low and capacity investments, for their part, have not followed.<EOL>
I deemed it necessary to rethink those provisions and, as a result, they will prove more effective, and hence the regulation provides the Commission with an important tool to monitor the activities of CRSs.<EOL>
Indeed, the June decision of the European Council was to have a further rendezvous and revisit this issue in spring 2006.<EOL>
These are places where such propaganda is broadcast and funds are collected to fuel the barbarous murder of innocent people, as in Madrid.<EOL>
Although we are abstaining on the Mastorakis report on establishing a European Agency for Maritime Safety, we shall be voting in favour of the Sterckx report, because it lays down practical measures to limit the risks of pollution and danger to crews' lives.<EOL>
A majority of members of visual artists' associations and representative bodies, with whom I have spoken during the last few years, now want to see European resale rights.<EOL>
As the Russian Government has failed to prove that it is not giving the orders and even refuses due cooperation with the British investigating authorities, this shows, consequently, that Russia's official involvement in the murder is politically proved.<EOL>
It is significantly more difficult to force institutional change.<EOL>
In order to meet them, we must move beyond the differences between and within our two continents.<EOL>
Guinea- B5­0098/01 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Guinea-Conakry;<EOL>
As agreed during the trialogue of March 1998, the final distribution between the reserve and the budget line should be decided in the Letter of Amendment that the Commission will transmit at the end of October to the budget authority.<EOL>
The alliance therefore falls outside of the scope of the Works Council Directive.<EOL>
(ES) Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and the whole House on the report that we have drawn up.<EOL>
Furthermore, a future quality policy must also be linked to the major potentialities of agriculture which, as in the European case, is modern, dynamic, rich and diversified and can offer not only high quality food products but also services of great value to a constantly evolving society.<EOL>
Of course the situation is tragic, but it is interesting to note today that we are able to talk about restructuring in industry not from a purely economic point of view, but raising the human issues that it involves.<EOL>
I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate - and I am saying this to President Barroso as well - your stopping funding for the Audiovisuel Méditerranée programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument.<EOL>
Things cannot simply be allowed to run their course because what we have here, as has been said, is an inbuilt structural defect in the international financial system.<EOL>
As provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union is now preparing to carry out the Petersberg tasks and missions, i.e. humanitarian and evacuation missions, peace-keeping, crisis-management and, where necessary, peace-making missions.<EOL>
To get straight to the point which interests me, I would like to say that I come from the mountains, and in this debate I want to express the opinion of those who live and work in mountain regions.<EOL>
First of all, the behaviour of the rebels has deteriorated and is still deteriorating more and more, particularly with regard to attacks on property.<EOL>
It is unreasonable that the Union is demanding that the country's bituminous shale-based production of electric energy, which is unable to compete in a freely competitive market, should swiftly become the object of free competition, while, at the same time, France, and to some extent Germany also, are still, after fifty years, obstructing the liberalisation of their own energy markets.<EOL>
With those comments, I can agree with the proposed strategy and I thank the rapporteur sincerely for his report.<EOL>
This is particularly so now that the Congress has refused fast-track for trade negotiations for the US President.<EOL>
The will of the citizens will only be effective once the Constitution has been ratified by a referendum of the people at European level.<EOL>
Allow me to enumerate briefly the main points which I identified in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and which were explicitly and emphatically reaffirmed by the future Commissioner from Latvia, Mrs Sandra Kalniete, at her hearing.<EOL>
Mass persecution occurs on a huge scale, with political opponents, Christians and also thousands of ordinary people as victims.<EOL>
Accusations of treason, the circulation of black lists, fatal shootings by the Israeli army in the Occupied Territories and the sentencing of young, refusenik soldiers are just some of the blows to the very idea of peace in the Middle East.<EOL>
We have a question which we will want to ask during the hearing of the Commissioners: were the measures envisaged properly envisaged, and were the declarations which were made correct and are they still valid?<EOL>
We have not always succeeded in this and there have been Members who have broken these rules, which is one of the main reasons why we want to improve our rules.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner, we have sufficient grounds for holding today's debate on the situation in Angola with a considerably greater degree of optimism and hope than in previous debates.<EOL>
Obviously there is nothing transient about our situation: that is quite permanent, but we are not asking for a permanent guarantee of aid at the same level in perpetuity, because our hope is to catch up with the average in the rest of the Community.<EOL>
I expect an answer from you, Mr President-inOffice.<EOL>
Furthermore, it is very important for the UNHRC to be better equipped to address both chronic and emergency situations, perhaps through the expansion of the human rights toolbox, by using panels not just during but also in-between sessions.<EOL>
The drivers of these vehicles are under particular pressure, as a great many of them deliver Internet orders and what are known as just-in-time services.<EOL>
I am pleased a number of colleagues, including Mr Glante, made that point as well.<EOL>
Finding new arrangements to redistribute just 5 % will not do.<EOL>
   Mr President, we are all fully aware of the fact that the number of goals we are setting ourselves, and the number of needs that must be met, exceeds by far the funds at our disposal.<EOL>
Here connections with Russia should be instrumental in finding a golden mean for the EU’s Russia policy.<EOL>
As he said, much of the debate which happens within the Council is filtering out in the form of discussion within the monthly bulletin, but this is not the same as a regular report with a formal framework in which it is discussed.<EOL>
The UN has broader international support and greater experience in handling crisis situations than the EU.<EOL>
(HU) I would like to comment on the report on Croatia and Macedonia.<EOL>
Mr President, the Commission intends to put forward a raft of proposals in 2009 for reducing the administrative burden that will change nothing in the level of demand for existing regulations or the political specifications.<EOL>
Moving on to the criteria governing the employment of workers, there are divisions among the Member States on basic principles as well as on procedural details.<EOL>
On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his accurate depiction of this complex problem, the solution to which is to slash the number of areas of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.<EOL>
Renewed sanctions must now be targeted and must be extremely damaging to the regime in Tehran.<EOL>
What we tried to do was swim through these four types of interest and I think we have done it fairly well in this report.<EOL>
The normal legal-linguistic verification process should deal with any remaining textual variations on this basis.<EOL>
   – Mrs Mann, that was not exactly a point of order according to the Rules of Procedure.<EOL>
The large number of multiple applications and the small number of transfers performed indicate deficiencies in the Dublin system and the need to create a common European asylum system.<EOL>
He was clear that the US was looking not just for our support for the overall strategy in Afghanistan, but also for commitment to match that support with concrete resources.<EOL>
We must be the voice of the women who have been denied the right to have a voice.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Reding, the vision of European contract law is clearly a wonderful one.<EOL>
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Vizjak, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to everyone for their input on this but especially to the rapporteur, Alexander Stubb, who was very helpful in including us, the shadow rapporteurs for his report, in all aspects of the discussions.<EOL>
Although falls from heights occur in circumstances where ladders and scaffolding are not present, the main focus of the proposal is on scaffolding, ladders and rope access, as you will see as you read.<EOL>
The other three delivered to feed mills in the first half of December 2010 were not contaminated.<EOL>
We must create both support and a structure for democratic development throughout the Middle East.<EOL>
The motives of young people in Morocco who have carried out attacks are often completely different from the motives of those who have done so in the Netherlands, for example the man who murdered Theo van Gogh.<EOL>
Fundamentally, the pipeline underlines the need, if ever we needed it underlined, for a European approach to energy supply.<EOL>
A sound industrial policy is needed, but not economic nationalism.<EOL>
Could it be that, when major economic interests are involved, we are rather less principled than with human rights?<EOL>
The value of an international currency is based on its external value.<EOL>
On visas for the citizens of the ten Member States not benefiting from the US visa-waiver programme, I can assure you that we are continuing to urge the US at all levels to recognise the new economic, social and political realities in the ten Member States which acceded to the European Union last year and which should be treated the same as the other Member States.<EOL>
Then there are two more points which I should like to address.<EOL>
The position of the EU should stay firmly on the side of those who are striving for freedom and who relentlessly support free elections.<EOL>
What does the Commission think about establishing a genuine fund that is on a par with the others, to meet all the needs of the EGF without restricting the role of the European Parliament which has been so involved in this issue?<EOL>
The short-term solution to this dispute lies in the hands of both governments and the UN Security Council, which should take the lead in imposing solutions to de-escalate the crisis.<EOL>
What better rebuke to the defenders of protectionism than this sorry affair?<EOL>
The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy.<EOL>
I think that we should be proud of the work we have done in the last few weeks.<EOL>
For this reason, the ECR Group has abstained.<EOL>
Furthermore, given that the overall amount of resources is limited, how was it decided to adjust input for the benefit of some Member States, which necessarily results in a corresponding decrease for the others?<EOL>
I call on the European Commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all Member States of the Union, and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children.<EOL>
Its observations are correct, and as my colleague, Mr Bösch said, the pre-accession funds provided very little if any help at all to the ten new Member States.<EOL>
I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that in Romania, even now, there is an ongoing process, using subtle methods, of homogenising and making Transylvania Romanian by artificially altering the ethnic proportions.<EOL>
Persistent uncertainty about what has actually occurred and who is responsible for alleged war crimes and other violations of international law is fuelling fear and panic among the civilian population.<EOL>
You mentioned the Barcelona Council and the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue - that is all very well - and you have also said, in your reply to Mrs McKenna, that the Council had not dealt with the issue of the Iraq war.<EOL>
In view of these considerations, it is indeed necessary to conduct tests for safety's sake.<EOL>
This is shown by the fact that the agenda for this plenary session also includes the reports by Mr Hammerstein Mintz, on the opening of Council meetings to the public; Mr Cashman, on access to the institutions’ texts; and Mrs Prets, on the European Capital of Culture.<EOL>
This is an excellent ambition.<EOL>
However, this value has not yet been fully implemented: women are discriminated against in recruitment for jobs, and they are paid significantly lower wages than men for the same work.<EOL>
Although I am in favour of Romania's accession to the Union in principle, I abstained on this report.<EOL>
There are not two peoples and two states: there is one state and something in development, a territory that is being constantly torn apart, both by this illegal wall and by force.<EOL>
The men had told the caretaker - and this is a significant point - that they were from the office of the public prosecutor.<EOL>
I do not agree with Members on that.<EOL>
The report also rightly notes that the European Union is the world's leading maritime power and that its outermost regions ensure that it has the world's largest exclusive economic zone.<EOL>
Mr Uribe's presence here shows that the European Union is moving towards getting involved in the ‘Columbia’ plan, through which the USA intervenes cruelly in this country, in an aim to achieve general control over the area.<EOL>
There are 111 State Parties to the ICC, with some regions under-represented, such as the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.<EOL>
This opinion confirmed that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank is of the opinion that the proposed candidate is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 112(2)(b) of the Treaty.<EOL>
There are people who are strangers in their own land, who have lost all human contact and the chance to feel at home in the world.<EOL>
To introduce such a rule additionally in the context of the penalty point system would be disproportionate.<EOL>
Adding substances that have never been used before to encourage fish to grow fast and thus increase the yield may contribute to further contamination of the sea.<EOL>
Now, as your rapporteur rightly stressed, religious fundamentalism of a violent nature will not be welcomed in the European Union.<EOL>
This morning's meeting leads us to believe that Parliament fully shares this objective.<EOL>
Firstly, it must hold talks with the environmental authorities and with the public affected and, secondly, it must initiate talks with the affected party or parties, meaning the neighbouring countries, which may be subject to the project's cross-border impact.<EOL>
For those products which do not have a list of ingredients, the necessary information must appear clearly on the product label.<EOL>
There is serious racketeering going on for this.'<EOL>
Of course, these are only the first steps in what will, of necessity, be a long, major process.<EOL>
I wish to concentrate on one particular area: promoting the social dialogue.<EOL>
Investment in research and in cooperation must lead to more economic growth and more employment.<EOL>
More than 80% of the world's top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe.<EOL>
The GDP is 76 % of the average according to my information at the moment.<EOL>
The Commissioner will in any event naturally answer you in writing, and you will therefore get your answer.<EOL>
Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles.<EOL>
This federal project for Europe will strengthen the expression of a true European identity and help spread our cultural and linguistic diversity across the world.<EOL>
There is a series of amendments which, in my opinion, are mistaken in their understanding of the nature of macroeconomic aid: these are Amendments Nos 2, 8 and 13, which refer to linking this type of macroeconomic aid with the CART programme, and they therefore ask for the same conditions as for the CART projects. However, we are not talking about CART, but about something completely different.<EOL>
However, I would like Parliament to help me out a bit, for example with regard to this point.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
The Commissioner stated that European integration called for courage, courage of thought and the courage to compromise.<EOL>
Enhancing cooperation calls for better and more effective application of the principle of positive comity.<EOL>
We have to embark on a new phase of consolidating and managing our achievements and fitting them to the new situation, but always in a disciplined manner and, above all, always treating everybody equally.<EOL>
A few days ago, the dissident, Suhayr al-Atassi, was released and this is a signal, though slight, which points to the development of freedom of thought and political freedom.<EOL>
European funding should be confined to rail projects in which ERTMS is taken into account.<EOL>
It is of the greatest importance that all nations concerned take part in the disarmament which is now finally able to take place.<EOL>
As all the points put forward by the Committee on Budgets have been taken up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we are quite satisfied from a budgetary point of view.<EOL>
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is right to say it is not just quantitative, it is qualitative much more than growth.<EOL>
This is the challenge.<EOL>
This language also appears in the reference to NATO.<EOL>
Otherwise, the differences will increase.<EOL>
That is why on 17 March 1995 this House adopted a resolution that henceforth there should be a separate discharge for the agricultural expenditure in the Guarantee section of the EAGGF.<EOL>
This proposal for a regulation enables us to update tools to improve the visibility and strengthen the appeal of Europe as a tourist destination of excellence.<EOL>
The new budgetary procedure includes real advances and new challenges for Parliament with, firstly, the removal of the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure.<EOL>
We need a certain amount of reserves.<EOL>
Some Member States that are slower in drawing down EU funds may pay the price of failing to prepare all of their projects by next year.<EOL>
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.<EOL>
The rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations, social instincts.<EOL>
I express my support for these priorities of the French presidency and I hope their implementation will be a success.<EOL>
On the European Union's borders, prostitution, sex tourism and the sexual exploitation of children have become a sad reality.<EOL>
This field needs to be simplified: everything related to basic information - concerning the democratic rule of law - should be made available free of charge, and other information should be made available at a marginal cost, except in what is known as the 'cultural' sector, for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright.<EOL>
The Presidency has launched several initiatives to this end, starting with the ministerial-level seminar that it organised at the very start of its term, in July.<EOL>
There are others too.<EOL>
Could the Commissioner tell us where our health services directive is and when we will have a draft proposal?<EOL>
I voted in favour of the resolution as I believe that strengthening economic governance must go hand in hand with reinforcing the democratic legitimacy of European governance, which must be achieved through the closer and more timely involvement of the European Parliament and of national parliaments throughout the process.<EOL>
   – The Internet is a universe of limitless freedom but, as there are no rules to control its use, it may also be a universe of infinite freedom to abuse, groom and violate.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner, the Council' s common positions within the framework of the railway package are not so much unexpected as they are disappointing in part.<EOL>
That is why the defence of this cultural treasure is a matter of political obligation – and I am talking here not only about the making of policy at European level, with its various programmes, but about the national level too.<EOL>
With the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the Commission recognised the role which the urban environment plays in the lives of so many European citizens and undertook to take action in this sector.<EOL>
Germany's recent decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 marks a new stage in the fundamental rethinking currently taking place in Europe concerning its energy independence and the possible alternatives to nuclear power.<EOL>
In the midst of the difficult circumstances that are now being imposed on us by the current financial crisis, which is not something totally unfamiliar as far as accounting standards are concerned, I hope that everyone of us will understand that we have to find a quick and practical solution that will help steer developments in the required direction.<EOL>
The Council’s desire to prevent the European Commission’s initiative from containing, for example, criminal law provisions, has created such confusion between civil sanctions, administrative procedures and administrative sanctions, that I cannot imagine what the Member States are going to do when it comes to applying it.<EOL>
Why?<EOL>
There is a lack of both clear criteria and sufficient guarantees that this procedure will not be at the expense of the fairness of the normal procedure.<EOL>
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Lipietz report on trade and climate change.<EOL>
The judicial proceedings have a chilling effect and damage the important work carried out by journalists, intellectuals and activists.<EOL>
First, improving knowledge about people's health, about health interventions and about the functioning of health systems.<EOL>
Research makes a fundamental contribution to economic growth, job creation and the creation of clean, sustainable energy.<EOL>
Social protection programmes should provide people with effective help and support them in finding stable employment.<EOL>
It is a subject which relates to and touches on a currently sensitive nerve, which is that of migration flows.<EOL>
The problem of counterfeiting is our key priority in relation to China, which is the number one source of fakes entering the EU external borders.<EOL>
- (SV) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would rather look at the opportunities of globalisation than the problems, but that depends on how we act in Europe.<EOL>
European Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House have consistently urged all parties to support the plan and we do so again now.<EOL>
In the end, no industry requires such a high level of capital investment for each job as the arms industry.<EOL>
It is an unfair attack on the way Parliament operates, and especially the way proceedings are conducted in Strasburg.<EOL>
This is not right, Commissioner, and I should like to hear your reply.<EOL>
The real pressure must be applied at home where the people who permitted and tolerated these actions will feel it.<EOL>
In countries like Zambia, one million children will die. The funds announced may appear to be substantial, but as my fellow Member said a moment ago, some questions remain to be answered.<EOL>
I am concerned that it looks as if more and more countries are abandoning clear and explicit restrictive attitudes to drug abuse.<EOL>
Because the peoples of Europe are much more interested, I believe, in the announcement of the objective of full employment, in strengthening social dialogue and in reinforcing the legal basis for public utility companies or for public health, than in whether there will be 13 or 23 Commissioners or if Europe will have 1 or 2 ministers for foreign affairs.<EOL>
What we are asking for in Parliament here, in the second reading of the Trakatellis, report is a continuation of that relationship with the European citizen, a continuation of the confidence that the European citizens have in us to deliver for them in real terms.<EOL>
The principles, priorities and aims of Slovakia's accession, of which the House has been informed, provide specifically that Slovakia must apply the internationally recognised principles of nuclear safety when the Mochovce nuclear power station comes into operation.<EOL>
I hope you will accept that situation.<EOL>
There is political fatigue in central and northern Europe about supporting the countries in trouble; there is reform fatigue in southern Europe about carrying out the necessary reforms.<EOL>
I believe that this is justified given the non-contradictory nature of its subject matter.<EOL>
We would never have seen a national parliament attacked like the European Parliament was attacked yesterday.<EOL>
In particular the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation is not there.<EOL>
Yet there can be no question that prioritising the fight against crime is equally important, particularly in this day and age.<EOL>
There has been a growth in production in countries where the labour market was opened to workers from new Member States, and unemployment levels have actually dropped.<EOL>
These proposals are worthy of support, or rather, they would be worthy of support if it were not for the fact that products that could be developed using controversial technologies have been included amongst advanced therapy products.<EOL>
How can Europe be a factor for peace and stability if it is unable to guarantee its own security?<EOL>
What should have been a celebration of progress turned sour as a result of the harassment of human rights defenders from Tunisia and abroad and media representatives, and of the restraints on activities in defence of human rights and democracy in Tunisia that have been developed on the Internet.<EOL>
Whatever some Members may claim, it is certainly not the intention to go beyond what is needed to enable the Community to be a party to the Århus Convention.<EOL>
(PL) Mr President, I too, of course, would like to thank Mr Gahler for his very good draft resolution and his fruitful cooperation.<EOL>
In spite of this, I hear tones of optimism and I see European countries queuing up - Mr Brok touched on the issue just now - and falling over themselves in the rush to recognise the Stalinist Pyongyang regime, turning a blind eye to what goes on in the country, to the tragic violations of human rights.<EOL>
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.<EOL>
What use are we making of these opportunities?<EOL>
President-in-Office of the Council.<EOL>
In a powerful contribution Mr Watson drew attention to the proximity and importance of Africa to the interests of the European Union.<EOL>
It was obviously out of excitement at this great event that I forgot to sign the register.<EOL>
As Vice-President Barrot reminded us, we are opening them in accordance with the rules.<EOL>
This year, however, the picture is very different.<EOL>
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some members of the World Trade Organization do not comply with fundamental social standards and use the violation of social rights to compete unfairly and to distort the rules of competition.<EOL>
In other words, currently around 86% and in future 90% of CO2 emissions come from elsewhere.<EOL>
These measures are not restricted to socio-economic development plans, the reopening of educational establishments or the reestablishment of the public pensions system, but they also extend to the drawing up of a draft constitution which will have to be put to a referendum.<EOL>
   – Mr President, the Council's enlargement strategy is wide of the mark.<EOL>
But here I need to reflect on this with my colleagues, Mrs Reding and Mr Bolkestein, who have particular competence in this field.<EOL>
So I know that there is a lot of work which has to be done now by our legal specialists in the Commission, Parliament and, most of all, in the Council.<EOL>
In defence of the scheme that we ourselves have prepared, I can say that, to a large extent, the question is whether the structure we are creating can be considered to be a legal entity, and whether it can consequently carry out the technical tasks to be dealt with.<EOL>
The existence of a small quota for Portugal could reduce its fishing deficit by 12 000 tonnes, which would help to keep afloat the rest of its deep-sea fleet.<EOL>
I am therefore abstaining in the final vote.<EOL>
I hope that the Commission will play its role and make sure the partnership delivers its objectives.<EOL>
Mr Rehn, I even believe that we must go beyond the Commission's proposals, and we must support Mr Trichet.<EOL>
Enlargement of the European Union must not mean that companies exploit a situation where there are low wages and poorer social security or that taxes and environmental demands are evaded.<EOL>
We are resolutely hostile to this, since the enfeoffment of national rights and legal specificities will surely lead to enfeoffment of the Member States themselves in a Europeist and federalist project.<EOL>
I wonder what is really better for the environment now.<EOL>
On those grounds I reassert the calls made in our resolution, especially to ensure maximum transparency by signposting contaminated areas and above all pursuing the idea of an immediate moratorium to achieve a complete ban soon on depleted uranium weapons and cluster bombs, which are still claiming victims.<EOL>
With reference to the discussion at yesterday's meeting of Foreign Ministers and to the statement we have just heard from the Italian Presidency, I would like to make the dual role of the future EU Foreign Minister very clear.<EOL>
While applications in the commercial and entertainment fields, for instance, are becoming increasingly varied and numerous, the field of public administrations is lagging behind at both national and EU level.<EOL>
I can tell the Council that they would be well advised not to conjure up any conflict between the institutions on this point.<EOL>
This would be, in the trade agreement, a stepping stone for increased cooperation, and would take us a step further in bringing the framework for dialogue with Turkmenistan on to a par with the ones we have already established with other countries in the region.<EOL>
It is a by-product of nuclear processing and must accordingly be treated as waste.<EOL>
We have awarded the prize to writers, journalists, politicians, professors, lawyers and organisations fighting for freedom of labour, and even associations of women fighting enforced disappearance.<EOL>
They have not been allowed to visit Mr Öcalan again and this all leads us to fear for his life, as has already been pointed out today.<EOL>
I voted in favour of this regulation on food labelling because its aim is to help consumers make more informed choices - by extending compulsory labelling to other nutrients and introducing new rules on country of origin - and because this proposal simplifies, updates and merges into a single piece of legislation seven directives and one regulation currently in force on food labelling, thus making the law simpler.<EOL>
We need to improve how we work together with Egypt and Tunisia, with North Africa.<EOL>
In conjunction with this, I think we should keep our eyes firmly fixed on justification 24, which considers expanding the use of speed limiters to light commercial vehicles as well.<EOL>
(NL) Mr President, in fact the number of people seeking to find a way into Europe has not increased, but the borders are guarded much better, so that people take more difficult and more dangerous routes.<EOL>
<EOL>
If this is to succeed, efficiency must always be a priority, combined, of course, at all times with the required degree of democratic legitimacy.<EOL>
<EOL>
How much life will actually be breathed into this project will certainly depend, amongst other things, on how the tension between the objectives of environmental protection and drawing the Danube region together are resolved and whether the Danube will suffice as the common denominator for the implementation of this mammoth project.<EOL>
The Member States must not be discharged from their responsibilities; the prevention of disasters is and remains a national responsibility, and it is for that reason that I take an extremely critical view of the EU's current acquisition of equipment, which represents what might be termed an attempt at duplication, and certainly is not beneficial.<EOL>
So there is also this very important aspect, that olive oil only represents 3 % of total oil sales worldwide, and is therefore a minute part of the world oil market.<EOL>
The issue of tobacco duties is a very difficult one to resolve due to the large differences in tax rates and views on the harmful effects of tobacco within the EU.<EOL>
There was a general atmosphere of disappointment and uncertainty.<EOL>
At a time when fewer and fewer of our own electorate were turning out to vote, it was in Ethiopia that I rediscovered democracy’s ‘sex appeal– if I might be permitted to use that frank and sloppy term.<EOL>
We can see from the details provided by the Member States that little progress has been made over the last three years and that there are huge discrepancies between the Member States.<EOL>
Parliament today approved the text of the recommendation tabled by Mr Goerens because it saw fit to amend Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation.<EOL>
I would ask the Council to continue to address this explosive situation.<EOL>
This is a very small sum when you think that the United States has given its military establishment USD 100 billion since September last year, and that is why President Bush promised a further USD 5 billion in development finance by 2006.<EOL>
The French National Front, with Jean-Marie Le Pen for whom I speak today, will vote to censure the European Commission and denounce this institution which is dedicated to building a supranationalist and federalist Europe and which, believing itself to be above the law, thinks that it can flout it with impunity.<EOL>
Obviously, information about political institutions bears the imprint of political values.<EOL>
We can debate this matter in a somewhat more peaceful frame of mind, but I have to tell you honestly that I am discussing it with mixed feelings.<EOL>
It is the weakness of the proposals concerning the institutional reforms aimed at democratizing the European institutions and improving their operation, above all with a view to enlargement.<EOL>
At the Seattle round, the scope and power of the WTO will grow significantly, and that is why the EU should ensure that the effects of the liberalisation of trade and the action of the WTO are continually appraised from the point of view of ecology and fairness.<EOL>
Mr President, Madam High Representative, I believe that, within this Chamber, everyone agrees that we must condemn the attack on the flotilla that was trying to break the Gaza blockade.<EOL>
More flexibility and fewer obstacles to the flow of information, fewer intellectual property barriers.<EOL>
The data will not be good, but I do not want to condemn it in advance because, if the Commission demonstrates that they have been well used in terms of programming, this will be a qualitative element which Parliament will have to take into account.<EOL>
Transparency is more necessary than ever if the construction of Europe is to make good progress.<EOL>
Freight transport in Europe (<EOL>
We need the know-how in order to build systems such as these independently in Europe and we also have to do something for the owners of our medium-sized enterprises, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will then, if the infrastructure has been set up, benefit from this by developing the applications in many sectors, to which we perhaps do not give much thought at all today: in the logistics sector, in the road haulage sector, in maritime, rail and air transport and in the security field.<EOL>
It is not a question of Russian roulette, Mrs Breyer.<EOL>
I would add that quite apart from the work she has done during the progress of this directive, she has presented it with such clarity this evening that it is completely unnecessary for me to say in any detail what the directive does and the advances that it has made.<EOL>
It is also important that the trend should be towards a technologically more neutral operational environment, and that the sector-oriented approach be abandoned as far as possible.<EOL>
Commissioner, although I respect the way in which you are trying to tackle aircraft noise, I should also like to hear from you - and if you were unable to respond straight away, you may be able to do so in writing - how we can prevent new sources of noise nuisance from emerging.<EOL>
Today we are facing new problems as a result of the globalisation of trade.<EOL>
It should therefore use all the political tools at its disposal, including the Association Agreement with Israel, in order to put an end to the violence.<EOL>
Of the 22 researchers that have been appointed, only four are women.<EOL>
Five hundred schools have been burnt down, thousands of people have fled from their homes and Governor Puteh has said that unemployment and poverty are now at alarming rates.<EOL>
The rapporteur proposes that we should go way beyond the ceiling on expenditure on external action.<EOL>
As you know, and as has already been mentioned earlier today, last Tuesday the Council convened an extraordinary Council meeting.<EOL>
We know that the climate is increasingly unsettled.<EOL>
Furthermore, it is time that the European Union recognised what has been obvious for a long time and include Hezbollah in the list of terrorist groups.<EOL>
I consider this to be an unacceptable situation.<EOL>
Of course, there is an element of parading before the media at these summits which is no longer tolerable.<EOL>
Today, the extremists have won and a no-go area has been established in the region.<EOL>
I think it would be wrong if we keep on looking at this question strictly from the point of view of taxation, we must also look at it from the perspective of the free movement of persons and services, two of the essential freedoms of the European Union.<EOL>
I do not know of any regulations so I sit here in vain.<EOL>
In the current computer system the guarantees are insufficient to ensure that all data has really been erased.<EOL>
My Group supports this decision and we hope that it will receive a huge vote in favour.<EOL>
9.<EOL>
   Mr President, the torrent of words, not to say hot air, about the main guidelines can no longer obscure the fact that the Lisbon process has stalled and that the European Union has no economic policy.<EOL>
It is worth repeating that the conservation of meagre resources, however renewable, is the vital issue.<EOL>
In essence, this is a good idea.<EOL>
I therefore consider, Mr Frattini, that we left the German Government without help.<EOL>
Is this a step in the right direction?<EOL>
The issue was also raised at the EU-Russia Summit of 6 November 2003 in Rome.<EOL>
It is a reliable fact that the seals in the North Sea are eating more white fish than the total allowable catch by the European Community.<EOL>
On the situation in Sudan, I fully share Parliament's analysis.<EOL>
I shall not comment on the individual provisions - though if I did so, the number of minuses would far outweigh the number of pluses - but I would say that I like the way in which the principle of subsidiarity and the role of the national parliaments have been developed in two separate protocols to the Treaty.<EOL>
(Loud applause)<EOL>
Mr Rocard has done an important job in attempting to reformulate the framework of the directive, and he deserves credit for it.<EOL>
We are committed to supporting such actions through the MEDA Programme, as well as the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the new thematic programmes.<EOL>
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.<EOL>
Madam President, I do not know whether this afternoon was the first time that you have been in the chair, presiding over Parliament.<EOL>
If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension.<EOL>
<EOL>
The most widely-used word in the House this morning was 'simplification'.<EOL>
Mr President, the reduction of defence expenditure in the Union's Member States, and consequently, the corresponding reduction of expenditure on defence research and technology, combined with the fragmented nature of the Western European defence market, have left the European defence industry in a situation of stagnation.<EOL>
I welcome the measures introduced by the European Commission with the aim of improving the environment in indoor spaces.<EOL>
The EU could have done two things, and it should do two things before the conference in Mexico.<EOL>
We should like to express our solidarity with those who have been affected and also, in particular, our hope for peace.<EOL>
We do not believe that the problem should be tackled in this way.<EOL>
And yet I am not very happy about the action that has now been launched, and while my group is completely at one in its perception of the problem, I am sure that different conclusions have been drawn as to whether the action that has been taken was really the best available option.<EOL>
The Committee on Industry concludes that the general principles of the UN approach are undisputed, but all the more so the policy.<EOL>
Between 2013 and 2016, Member States may also use revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances to support the construction of highly efficient power plants, including new energy power plants that are CCS-ready.<EOL>
Innocent civilians, law enforcement personnel and government officials have lost their lives in the ongoing struggle in the region.<EOL>
Some weeks ago I revealed to this Parliament Commissioner Barrot's past and the affair was whitewashed.<EOL>
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.<EOL>
I want to discuss just a few points in it.<EOL>
The problem is whether the community should be required to acknowledge forms of union which are not geared to procreation.<EOL>
Having said all that, Madam President, and speaking now in a personal capacity - since the Group of the European People's Party will vote according to the rapporteur's voting list - I am going to mention a few doubts.<EOL>
We must step up the pressure on Japan, and I believe that we should also look at the specific situation of the G 77.<EOL>
A common European strategy is obviously needed, but the European Union will not get anywhere if it is acting alone.<EOL>
Allow me to point out a danger.<EOL>
Labour MEPs did not move a single amendment to bring the proposal more into line with their Government's wishes!<EOL>
Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty we now have to make a choice as regards the legal base for the proposed Regulation which amends the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Regulation.<EOL>
I do not have an overview, and can only comment on my own area where I am very familiar with the situation.<EOL>
As in the case of Morocco, there is currently severe competition between the US and the EU as to who will enter first - and under which conditions - into key new markets.<EOL>
Let us stop getting bogged down by product-by-product wrangling.<EOL>
Or will I be punished through the withdrawal of my daily subsistence allowance if I dare to call out 'referendum'?<EOL>
It is possible that cooperation with the new US administration will enable it to come up with a specific way to implement this agreement.<EOL>
It took almost one and a half years for the Commission services to find the six to seven people to send to Managua to form the unit to run the implementation of the regional reconstruction programme of EUR 250m.<EOL>
It incorporates the fundamentals of the antisocial measures implemented in other countries, like Greece and Ireland, as well as those included in the 'Euro Plus Pact' imposed by the European powers.<EOL>
This also follows from the principle of public trust in the state.<EOL>
Sometimes, the question is even raised as to whether this policy should exist at all.<EOL>
This is why the Commission sees the maritime policy, and especially its environmental pillar, the Marine Strategy Directive, as key to the implementation of an ecosystem approach.<EOL>
All these issues are absolutely integral to the relationship between civil justice and the internal market.<EOL>
I trust and am sure he will show himself no less resolute in pressing home cases which have to be brought to a conclusion speedily.<EOL>
<EOL>
Your objective, from Copenhagen to Copenhagen, has been crystal-clear all down the line.<EOL>
(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Cizelj, for her excellent and inspiring report.<EOL>
This is why the proposed actions must be coupled with actions in the framework of the multi-annual programme for small and medium-sized businesses.<EOL>
That is why I hope that Parliament will deliver a positive opinion on this new regulation.<EOL>
The occupation has also robbed us of freedom.’<EOL>
A kind of founding charter, a symbol of exactly that kind of thinking in the 20th century was, for example, Lenin's suppression of the uprising of the heroic Kronstadt sailors.<EOL>
Secondly, I should like to recall here, Mr President, that on the other two occasions on which I spoke against the death penalty I talked about a Spaniard who was on death row in the United States, Joaquín José Martínez.<EOL>
Everything has failed so far, but the sanctions must be intensified.<EOL>
The motion for a resolution also refers to the very critical human rights situation in Uzbekistan.<EOL>
I also welcome the recommendations from Mr Lisi that we should closely monitor leisure fishing.<EOL>
Three and a half years later, in December last year, the Commission published the draft block exemption and guidelines.<EOL>
With regard to the concept of the family, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Directive acknowledges freedom of movement of registered partnerships and that Article 3 provides a clause facilitating the freedom of movement of durable relationships.<EOL>
That is the objective of the Commission proposal.<EOL>
It services global enterprises thus enabling hundreds of thousands of people to improve their standard of living.<EOL>
It remains the case that the Commission would actually be much better placed to control the EU's funds itself, rather than via the EIB.<EOL>
The policy must be ongoing in nature, and have commonly agreed aims and appropriate limits in terms of time periods and areas covered.<EOL>
At least two meetings a year, if not three, should take place.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the party statute and the resulting statute on political parties is of far greater significance than most people probably believe.<EOL>
I hope that the Presidency will encourage the consolidation of a system that will give greater permanency to this type of operation.<EOL>
I support the second amendment, which includes social partners in the implementation of the regulation.<EOL>
I voted for this text, which represents genuine progress for women.<EOL>
I would like to emphasise that, besides the areas most frequently criticised, we must also not forget about the areas of human rights and minority rights.<EOL>
I am aware that the agreement negotiated will not resolve the complex and multidimensional problem of counterfeiting, but I believe it constitutes a step in the right direction.<EOL>
If the principle of additionality is not rigorously enforced and independently verified, it makes it very difficult for European Union institutions and national EU governments to ensure that the competitive position of those regions most in need is improved.<EOL>
The United States turned down the first candidate proposed by the Europeans to head the International Monetary Fund; the countries of Europe did not do the same when Mr Wolfowitz was presented as the candidate to direct the World Bank.<EOL>
That is a tool which has not achieved a great deal of success so far.<EOL>
In addition, the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports.<EOL>
European urban diversity must be supported primarily by a flexible mechanism for implementing cohesion policy and by coordinating and adapting urban development projects according to the development needs and strategic guidelines of each city individually.<EOL>
I should like to take up what Mrs Pack said.<EOL>
Although the only objective of the new European body is to give scientific opinions to the Community institutions and to Member States, it is obvious that it will circumvent or neutralise the opinions of national food-safety agencies, such as the AFSSA in France, so as to prevent governments from having a legitimate reason to base their decisions on those agencies.<EOL>
This is a matter of solidarity in Europe.<EOL>
All the Member States of the European Union, by parliament or by popular vote, have approved the Treaty.<EOL>
It is in keeping with the authority of Parliament that we stick to the facts in the resolutions.<EOL>
Within the current rules, the financial crisis could indeed prevent new members joining the euro zone as scheduled.<EOL>
It has had the same effect on my fellow MEPs of the socialist group, with whom I usually manage to come to an agreement very quickly whenever I mention frontier work.<EOL>
When Germans have French names or names that look French, they are often pronounced quite differently in Germany.<EOL>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.<EOL>
The Commission should show courage and acknowledge openly measures which affect competition between energy sources.<EOL>
That was a decision I said that I would put before the Commission some weeks ago.<EOL>
Then there is the environmental crisis, which is probably the worst.<EOL>
<EOL>
(Sinn Fein stands for change in Ireland and across the EU and we look forward to working with others who want to see a Europe of equals and a globally responsible EU.)<EOL>
Within the bounds of this agenda, we will try to take your concerns into account as far as possible.<EOL>
In 2007, the Union could comprise 28 Member States and around half a billion citizens, and it will have a new constitutional framework.<EOL>
A clear target has been set by the European Council to deliver by June 2011.<EOL>
Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs is the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness and efforts in creating a generation of young people that will become more socially involved.<EOL>
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes<EOL>
We are able to find answers to external threats, such as international terrorism or the conduct of large neighbouring countries which occasionally trample the rules of international law under foot.<EOL>
In parallel, we will be confirming our political will to support cultural activity in the European Union and to create a single European cultural area within which the cultural individualities and values of our countries can flourish and develop.<EOL>
We must focus on this issue at the same time as evaluating the rules that appear in the new legislation, which is due to enter into force by December, since we have specifically targeted conflicts of interest in a bid to reduce them.<EOL>
Madam President, Commissioner, the euro creates a de facto economic solidarity among eleven of our countries.<EOL>
The issue of market forces has also been raised, as there are no guarantees that the regulations introduced by ourselves, however good, useful, appropriate and beneficial for drivers they may be, will result in an immediate exchange of vehicles in favour of cars that we consider to be safer, more efficient and easier to use.<EOL>
In essence, the mandatory mention of the energy label in advertisements will put an end to misinformation of end users, giving them all the information they need to make fully informed choices.<EOL>
The job is not yet finished, Madam President.<EOL>
The American economy, as we are forever being told, is on hold and this situation is decidedly bad for growth.<EOL>
Looking at the whole range of industrial tariffs, the honourable Member will note that both the US and the EU maintain high import tariffs in some sectors, but not necessarily in the same ones.<EOL>
More relevant perhaps is the review of some policy instruments in light of the available experience.<EOL>
This means that, despite the strategic framework, gender efforts in development cooperation could be reduced to rhetoric in the years to come.<EOL>
The Council also welcomes the Commission's decision to mobilise supplementary funds needed by Frontex to continue its planned joint operations.<EOL>
So, in summary, the vast majority of our group will not be voting in favour of this motion as it stands because we deem it to be imbalanced.<EOL>
Again a relevant Justice and Home Affairs agenda would focus on these issues: implementing the European Union action plan on counter-terrorism, which has huge potential to improve law enforcement as well as addressing the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists; cross-border intelligence and policing on organised crime; developing proposals to hit the people and drug traffickers hard in opening up their bank accounts, harassing their activities, arresting their leading members and bringing them to justice; getting returns agreements for failed asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries and others; developing biometric technology to make Europe’s borders secure.<EOL>
Quotations from Jean Monnet on the spirit of integration, dialogue and common activity, common actions, are very important for us.<EOL>
It will now continue to haunt all of you who have literally massacred international law here.<EOL>
The challenging task is to find the right balance.<EOL>
Hake are not caught only by industrial fishing vessels and cod are caught in very small quantities.<EOL>
With regard to the reconstruction agency, I would like to thank Mr Fischler for his frankness.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
The euro provides just such an alternative, and as a result the US will have to take a more critical look at its balance of payments deficit.<EOL>
We have voted against this report on food prices in Europe.<EOL>
Mr President, it has become universally acknowledged that environmental pollution, and certainly air pollution, are cross-border issues par excellence.<EOL>
There is a lack of leadership because, whilst the US has managed to convey an image of pragmatism, showing that it will not lose control of the situation, Europe has conveyed an image of disorder and even contradiction.<EOL>
I have not presumed in any of what I have said to decide (how could I?) how long Mr Kaczyński will continue as President of Poland.<EOL>
At least we managed to support the rapporteur's proposals to have some definition as to what the 'concerned public' might be.<EOL>
These challenges consist not only in providing effective assistance for the creation of interstate or economic cooperation.<EOL>
However, a deal in Copenhagen is by no means a given: much work remains to be done.<EOL>
As a result of this unorthodox behaviour, Greece is mourning three victims today, the death of three workers as a result of aggressive protests by other workers.<EOL>
This 'one-size-fits-all' policy, to quote one economist, is not suited to the present situation of France and Germany. It is having a recessionary effect in these countries.<EOL>
Those who do not submit to the prevailing EU ideology are described as anti-Europeans.<EOL>
We can have the technology to give people complete control.<EOL>
There are still further reports to be received in terms of the position of Croatia, not least in terms of the Croatia Task Force.<EOL>
When optimising capacity, it is important to pay attention to airport facilities, vehicles that transport passengers and ensuring that disabled people can approach aircraft, since this is the only way to ensure equality in air transport.<EOL>
When the leaders of the European countries sit down with the Americans and other allies there is a remarkable unanimity.<EOL>
What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas.<EOL>
I am speaking on the European judicial area in civil matters.<EOL>
<EOL>
I am, by the way, astonished to learn, from the Turkish Ambassador, that the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, was opposed to the amendments referring to the Armenian genocide, whilst the political group to which he belongs played an active part in having this crime recognised as such by the French National Assembly.<EOL>
<EOL>
During this morning' s debate on asylum and immigration, several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views.<EOL>
Everyone has put forward their view in clear, concise, sometimes lengthy, yet forceful terms.<EOL>
I think that is where our greatest potential lies.<EOL>
However, contrary to what has been suggested, this proposal does not merely suggest training people to use ladders, nor does it outlaw the use of ladders.<EOL>
But what is European awareness?<EOL>
We agree with the Council that it is not right simply and solely to criticise Turkey.<EOL>
In my opinion, we have not had such a plan up to now, or at least we have had too little of one, and I think that you would agree with us there.<EOL>
This means promoting policies which support women.<EOL>
We must also celebrate the courage of the rebels of Berlin, Prague and Budapest, who were crushed by the Soviet tanks, as well as the courage of all those who fought for their freedom and the independence of their countries, despite the persecutions, arbitrary arrests, confinements in psychiatric hospitals and deportations to the Gulag.<EOL>
However, given that there are still salary differences and that legislation has been unable to reduce them, it seems that any measure that we can take might be of use. One formula that might be useful would be first of all to encourage training and information for women so that they can accede to collective bargaining.<EOL>
We do not exclude - quite the contrary - a possible need for binding targets for each country, but let us also give the Member States ownership of this policy and see how they develop their strategy.<EOL>
I have asked my services to look at this particular point to try and achieve an outcome that you might like, while at the same time ensuring that the rules of the operation of the internal market are not damaged.<EOL>
This autumn we have followed daily, with growing concern, the continued military action in Chechnya.<EOL>
Communitarisation - that is, the loss of national sovereignty - is all the more serious when it is promoted in a context characterised by Community policies and measures which dangerously compromise citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees that represent the progress of civilisation and fundamental democratic achievements.<EOL>
Paragraph 12 of the joint resolution calls for closer cooperation and dialogue between Ukraine and the European Parliament on energy-related matters.<EOL>
There are situations in political life when one would gladly avoid making certain statements or adopting a particular type of speech.<EOL>
They refused to accept them and they refused to accept the Council's counter proposals and the compromises offered by the Commission, insisting instead on their own ideological position.<EOL>
This I regard as an affront, and none of our Members should have any part in such a meeting, held here in this House but ignoring the vote.<EOL>
The media should also be asked to exercise restraint and avoid creating panic.<EOL>
If, for example, we were to discuss our course of action regarding Iran, this would not be a matter of arms, but of politics.<EOL>
Kenya will be another example of how seriously we take our own human rights clauses, which we insist on having in agreements, and how effectively we are able to enforce them.<EOL>
The Commission will simply be responsible for managing the system's technical infrastructure.<EOL>
'Strongly condemns the illegal detention of Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi, together with their wives, by Iranian security forces and calls for their immediate and unconditional release; points out that the detention was carried out in violation of Iranian law; condemns the attitude of the Iranian authorities to the opposition exercising its legitimate right to protest and declares its solidarity with the Iranian people in their democratic aspirations; deplores the hypocrisy of the Iranian Government, which used excessive force, intimidation and arbitrary arrests against peaceful demonstrators demonstrating in solidarity with the Egyptian people on 14 February 2011, whilst claiming to support freedom in Egypt';<EOL>
There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight.<EOL>
We regret that the European Parliament did not support this amendment, especially because only 19 votes more were needed for the necessary majority.<EOL>
Despite this, the road ahead is clear: only by facing the challenge of the future can we retain the achievements of today.<EOL>
My most recent visit to India, however, has also shown how vulnerable even artists feel vis-à-vis mob pressure on the streets.<EOL>
Our discussion on Tuesday showed that there are other challenges before us, for instance, a greater accountability for the key financial actors, in particular, the Member States, and a cost-effective control policy based on risk and performance.<EOL>
Subject: Frontex<EOL>
The next item is the statement by Mr Prodi, President-designate of the Commission.<EOL>
People now act as if it were a system which only applies to women, but it is a system that is used in many areas of society.<EOL>
Refugees from Aceh have told me how hopeless the situation has become.<EOL>
Thank you very much, Commissioner.<EOL>
Altogether the programme seems rather superfluous; the resources could no doubt be used to better effect in the development of renewable energy and programmes to promote energy saving.<EOL>
In order to achieve these objectives, however, the cohesion policies need to be changed and reformed in a number of ways.<EOL>
We voted for it because we achieved, through the agreement signed between Parliament, the Council and Commission, the introduction of an improved labelling system.<EOL>
We are talking about the support measures, about compensatory measures for our farmers in Europe.<EOL>
We support further studies.<EOL>
For me, European law is always the benchmark.<EOL>
For all of these reasons the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes it is very much justified in voting against the draft regulation.<EOL>
Mr President, the danger with foreign policy initiatives designed to counter terrorism following the 11 September disaster is that we are deluded into thinking that in the parts of the world where this strategy has been deployed everything has therefore been resolved.<EOL>
In essence, therefore, your rapporteur is inviting the House to reiterate the position expressed at first reading, by approving all the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which have been accepted by all the political groups.<EOL>
(RO) In the Accession Treaty to the European Union, Romania undertook to organise elections for the European Parliament by the end of this year.<EOL>
There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot - and I could go on indefinitely, mentioning, for example, an electoral commission that was independent solely in name, but in fact was closely linked to the government.<EOL>
Attack on a train in the Republic of Angola- B5-0544/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs Lucas and Mrs Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Angola;<EOL>
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.<EOL>
At the very moment it declared independence, Croatia decided that the European Union was the key to its future.<EOL>
Just as firmly rooted is the fact that those on the Israeli side who seek to sabotage every small step forward because they are pursuing their own agenda succeed repeatedly in undermining even the most minimal progress by means of provocation.<EOL>
So in my opinion, the European Parliament should address this question to the European Commission.<EOL>
I also believe that the regulations on passengers’ rights and their extension to domestic traffic are particularly important.<EOL>
It has taken a while before the report could be included on the agenda - indeed, it was already completed in November - but it is good to uphold this tradition.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
I have to say to the honourable Member that it is an interesting speculation that the Union should consider new areas of expenditure.<EOL>
The Commission, in estimating spending, should look at funding in its totality.<EOL>
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the committee chairs, the President and the members of the Conciliation Committee, and all the individual Members of Parliament who have brought their commitment and expertise to bear.<EOL>
I would appeal to the Italian Presidency, therefore, not to kowtow to threatening language, to restraints, to blackmail by Member States, and rather to encourage free, equal and open debates.<EOL>
That is evidence of the fact that, if we want to be more secure against terrorism and organised crime, we need the European Constitution as a more effective means of making obligations in the common sphere more binding and improving the decision-making process.<EOL>
Elections held in Kyrgyzstan were rigged, following which the president was forced from power by popular protests, with Bishkek the next to be hit by the domino effect that had already seen the governments in Tbilisi and Kiev overthrown.<EOL>
That is why we agree with many of the proposals presented here, emphasising the need for promotion of women's access to all the artistic professions and other professional activities related to performance in which they are in the minority.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
In preparing this proposal, the Commission worked closely with the industry and NGO stakeholders to make sure the result was environmentally ambitious as well as politically and practically feasible.<EOL>
The third energy package forms the basis of this.<EOL>
This European initiative is to be welcomed as a means of better coordinating the EU's work against dementia.<EOL>
The recent report entitled 'Child Abuse on the Internet', along with other research, indicates the scale of paedophile abuse of information technology.<EOL>
Thank you both for demonstrating that, which has made the point that many of us have long sought to make.<EOL>
Of course this also impacts on the insurance industry, where existing barriers have to be broken down gradually.<EOL>
After a period of unusually high uncertainty in the context of the financial-market correction, in July 2008 the Governing Council has brought the minimum bid rate in the euro system's main refinancing operations to 4.25%.<EOL>
The Swedish Presidency talked about resettling 100 000 per year and the Belgian Presidency, at the end of its own term said - we had Prime Minister Yves Leterme here -that refugees were the image of the European Union's very raison d'être.<EOL>
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.<EOL>
It is highly regrettable, however, to discover once again that Community responsibility for defining and penalising racist and xenophobic crimes is to be based on the lowest common denominator.<EOL>
In Kosovo's evolution to independence and Macedonia's NATO membership veto there may lurk potential dangers.<EOL>
This will very likely result in uncontrollable overfishing and, in the worst case scenario, it may threaten the survival of tuna in the region.<EOL>
We have sadly come to doubt the European Parliament's willingness to cooperate within the spirit of the UN and to work with its institutions.<EOL>
Recuperation is in progress but the publication of the data is strictly the responsibility of the competent customs authorities.<EOL>
We have proposed financial support for a network of ombudspersons for children, and a single number for children's emergency telephones throughout Europe.<EOL>
Mr President, we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are clearly working on a joint position which we will vote on at noon, in order to condemn violence and support dialogue, but also so that the short-term efforts, such as the appointment of a mediator and the support for the Traikovski plan, should be immediate measures.<EOL>
It is certainly progress which can be further improved, but I still believe that this constitutes an important step for Europe' s workers.<EOL>
That not only defeats totalitarianism, it defeats all ills which face humankind today and that is why your idea of a cultural dialogue, of an understanding of different faiths and traditions is so important for the future development of Europe.<EOL>
Who is so interested in the possible deposits of oil and gas between the shores of the island and the federal state of Tamil Nadu?<EOL>
<EOL>
They have to be taken into account, but it does not mean that as a consequence of Article 153(5), no measures having an effect on pay can be adopted on the basis of Article 122.<EOL>
The agreement between the Congolese government and the Congolese rebel groups, including Mr Nkunda's CNDP, in January 2008, known as the Goma process, has also broken down.<EOL>
As experience in Europe since 1988 has shown, the drafting of standards is a long and complex process.<EOL>
We must ensure that companies cannot shirk from assuming responsibility.<EOL>
Could we have a guarantee from the President-in-Office that, whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1 %, they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being?<EOL>
The report can inspire consumers not to choose, at a market or in a supermarket, only the best-looking produce but to give priority, for the sake of their health, to less visually appealing but healthier bioproducts.<EOL>
I am not saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should just have blindly approved the Convention’s draft, as, moreover, the Heads of State and Government were wise to do in the case of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights; I am saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should purely have checked for shortcomings and contradictions in the Convention’s draft, as it should be doing now, and discussed how to overcome them.<EOL>
I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved.<EOL>
We must enter into the conciliation procedure on those four directives simultaneously.<EOL>
There is still the whole second half, or the ratification process.<EOL>
Hence there must also be a strategy for childcare.<EOL>
Secondly, we are not in favour of harmonising criminal legislation and the administration of justice in the Member States.<EOL>
If there is one area where European countries could benefit from standing foursquare behind the European flag, it is on relations with China.<EOL>
It ought to be possible to spend the proposed sums of money on other things, for which reason we are completely abstaining from voting.<EOL>
I therefore have to inform Parliament that the Commission is of the opinion that the proposed Amendments Nos 3 to 7 and 14 to 19 are a step backwards from the point of view of an effective legal instrument of the European Union.<EOL>
The Commission strongly believes that unjustified or unnecessary ethnic profiling is an unfair and prohibited practice, even when this is done for law-enforcement purposes or in connection with immigration, customs and border control, and is contrary to the fundamental values of the European Union.<EOL>
This was not a natural disaster but a system failure, and we should analyse it and draw the necessary lessons from it.<EOL>
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate.<EOL>
It is financial blackmail and it offends every aspect of international law.<EOL>
Mrs Miguélez Ramos is, as you know, the senior vice-chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and is one of the most dedicated and hard-working members of that committee.<EOL>
Now you need to start putting it into practice.<EOL>
However, if we now review the last fifteen months, then actually the Commission has not done very much to strengthen OLAF.<EOL>
In this Parliament we have always been concerned about relations and tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation succeeded in getting the ambassadors from both countries to attend several meetings it organised - something which no-one else has managed to do.<EOL>
I was told that, even if it were possible, it would take several months to find this information.<EOL>
These countries have learnt to create new wealth from the waste, although often at the expense of serious harm to the environment.<EOL>
The joint Rivellini-Gräßle report attempts to address these problems.<EOL>
Intolerance and anti-Semitism in all their manifestations are abhorrent to the values that we represent.<EOL>
At present there is too much confusion regarding where citizens should go when they want to make a complaint.<EOL>
It is currently young, well educated and highly paid men who clearly predominate in the field of information technology.<EOL>
That is illustrated by the size of the GNP levy, the fourth historical resource of the European budget, which has only been in existence since 1988.<EOL>
Allow me to address a few key points that surfaced, so to speak, in the debate.<EOL>
But instead of backing down on the fundamental values of the EU, we should not be afraid of applying the 'method of the stick' where necessary to show that, when certain basic requirements are not met, there will also be dire consequences that third parties are wisely advised to avoid.<EOL>
We are absolutely determined to see two things in integrated maritime policy (IMP).<EOL>
This is heightened by the recent Treaty of Nice and will be exacerbated by closer cooperation between governments centred on the new convergence criteria.<EOL>
When one claims to protect public health, one must put the interests of the community first and one must take into account the health of all human beings, whether or not they can afford to pay.<EOL>
The ESA regulations are subject to the staff regulations adopted by the EU institutions.<EOL>
That is a fact.<EOL>
There must be no repeat of the disgraceful episode in May when the Burmese Foreign Minister was allowed to attend an ASEM summit meeting in Germany in flagrant violation of the EU's own travel ban.<EOL>
In 1996 a delegation of MEPs realized however that the approved money was not getting through in the full amount.<EOL>
As the rapporteur, I do not want to discuss the details of those provisions at this stage, but there are two points I would like to make.<EOL>
That is why, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I hope the rapporteur will be able to preserve the overall cohesion of our budget, which represents an indissoluble whole.<EOL>
This is also shown by the fact that, based on last week's authorisation granted by the Member States, we are ready to start informal trialogues on the Asylum Qualification Directive as soon as possible in order to achieve the target date of 2012.<EOL>
It is sober and balanced, with certain themes for consideration, but without ideological excursions and ideas which have no connection with the real world.<EOL>
I thank all of you once again.<EOL>
Yet the company that replied to my constituent stated, and I quote: 'Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 does not impose any obligation on carriers to offer or pay compensation when passengers are delayed'.<EOL>
<EOL>
<EOL>
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly astounded by the instrumental tone of this debate.<EOL>
That is why it seemed certain that Romania would be joining later than Bulgaria, together with Croatia at the very earliest.<EOL>
Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the Stability Pact several times, but not once did you mention the Growth Pact!<EOL>
I do not see why we should become estranged or split or damage the capacity that we have to continue working together. But then again, we are not trying to create a European army.<EOL>
There are also advertisements warning of the illeffects of tobacco.<EOL>
We need to move towards reducing the administrative burdens faced by beneficiaries, including by making wider use of eGovernment facilities, and towards strengthening the role played by local and regional authorities, as well as socio-economic partners.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
But, for example, we have situations, as in the case of restrictions on liquids in aeroplanes, where comitology has been used in a shameful way to impose, through a secret piece of regulation - and I emphasise, a secret piece of regulation - duties on citizens which cannot be reviewed by any court in Europe, national or European.<EOL>
Thank you for your cooperation.<EOL>
Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the report and congratulating the rapporteur.<EOL>
This House has already made a preliminary assessment of what the subsequent costs will be.<EOL>
It has since been amended several times.<EOL>
Let me, then, remind the Commission that it did itself commission a study evaluating the European trade defence instruments, the conclusion of which was that the status quo was both the most reasonable solution and the one best suited to addressing the concerns of all parties.<EOL>
That being the case, public contracts must be awarded under transparent conditions whereby all interested parties are treated equally and the relationship between price and project performance is the ultimate criterion, so that they go to the best tender overall and not the one that is, perhaps, merely the cheapest.<EOL>
Equally, a system of classification must take into account the needs of the elderly and the disabled.<EOL>
In terms of economic relations, the agreements bring benefits for both parties' industries.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
Balance is essential.<EOL>
Things improved with the new leader in Mitsos.<EOL>
Mrs Redondo, I have to tell you that Mr Cunha has just come in.<EOL>
Another example is the goal of a 'fifth freedom': the freedom of circulation of knowledge.<EOL>
Question No 12 by Sarah Ludford , which has been taken over by Mrs Thors (H-0241/03):<EOL>
By objective criteria I mean beef production and beef consumption.<EOL>
In any case, the provisions relating to the classification of substances that we are about to vote on must be adapted and integrated so that they correspond to the principal regulation on the classification, labelling, and packaging of substances and mixtures without adding any new elements.<EOL>
The rapporteur agreed this text with four of the groups in Parliament and presented it to this House in what I see as a very undignified manner, with new versions of the English text being presented day after day over the last week.<EOL>
A destructive neoliberal concept has been turned into socially responsible legislation.<EOL>
First of all Ukrainian officials demanded rigorous identity checks from all voters, something we do not do in Britain.<EOL>
According to the wording of the directive, in theory the consumer could insist on the hair dryer being repaired eleven months later.<EOL>
A Single Sky will be a major contribution to reducing pollution, emissions and wasted fossil fuel.<EOL>
This applies fully to the EU's relations with Azerbaijan too.<EOL>
The least developed countries make hardly any contribution to climate change but have to suffer its gravest consequences.<EOL>
We accepted all the socialist rapporteur's proposals.<EOL>
Article 4 of the proposal dealt with by Mr Swoboda should be implemented immediately.<EOL>
The EU must support European political foundations, and promote and strengthen European political organisations and youth movements.<EOL>
In answer to the first question, I can't submit an assessment to this Parliament until it has been undertaken.<EOL>
in writing. - I welcome the proposed initiative to improve healthcare for people suffering from rare diseases.<EOL>
I emphasized in my reply that the Commission has already announced its intention to appeal.<EOL>
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this is not an objection, but just a suggestion: perhaps representatives of the Commission and Council could make a brief statement on this very precarious situation.<EOL>
At the same time they confirm the willingness of European research centres to set up communities that begin by concentrating on three sectors: renewable energy, climate change and information technology.<EOL>
Torture is one of the most pressing problems in Turkey.<EOL>
I have special misgivings regarding Amendments Nos 6 and 7, which Mr Crowley referred to in particular.<EOL>
Israel is, in effect, keeping one and a half million people in a form of prison camp, surrounded by walls, patrolled by armed guards.<EOL>
Report (A5-0080/2002) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the d raft Framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law [15525/2001 - C5-0022/2002 - 2000/0801(CNS)]<EOL>
Can the Commission provide a progress report on the applicant countries= preparations for modernising their social security systems and can it also report on present and planned measures to further the applicant countries= efforts in this respect?<EOL>
As pointed out in the committee's report, the EU faces major global challenges.<EOL>
Another sector I should like to touch upon is that of temporary employment.<EOL>
Consequently, this will perhaps affect their profitability a little, but it will not challenge their existence in Europe.<EOL>
It is a matter of extreme urgency that this matter is resolved as quickly as possible.<EOL>
It has not been achieved for the sake of demagogy but because we really have to create an area of peace in the Mediterranean.<EOL>
One rightly wonders if speeding up the process of liberalisation and privatisation already under way risks exacerbating the situation.<EOL>
They play a crucial role in monitoring violations and advising governments on human rights improvements.<EOL>
Many Members have talked about the issue of drugs.<EOL>
It is more like a reflection put to paper that is now being steamrollered through in a fast-tracked procedure.<EOL>
Half of the country's territory is below sea level.<EOL>
Furthermore, we reject the proposal in the report that the EU should have its own resources instead of relying on the contributions of the Member States.<EOL>
On the contrary, the further removal of trade restrictions which the Commission wants to push through will encourage globalisation, benefit large companies and cause damage to the Member States and their citizens.<EOL>
This is another area that we should tackle.<EOL>
On the Marinescu report, I deliberately voted for the Marinescu report.<EOL>
The two were unrelated.<EOL>
The Commission finds that a very valuable suggestion and we should like to consider it further.<EOL>
Apart from this, on the occasion of this debate, we would like to note a few concerns.<EOL>
The report indicates a range of obstacles to be overcome.<EOL>
Firstly, each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides.<EOL>
We want the war in Kosovo to end immediately, and we want the bombing to stop. But there are some things we do not know.<EOL>
Odysseus overcame both monsters, but he needed ingenuity, persistence and courage.<EOL>
It is very clear that there, too, new violations may occur.<EOL>
We must keep these two points of reference and try to urge, to pressure the parties so that the negotiations are real, genuine and internationally guaranteed.<EOL>
It is a myth that the European Union is in a crisis or paralysed and incapable of taking decisions, and this is the pretext that some governments are using to demand that the Constitution should be back on the table.<EOL>
In my view, the session must be held as normal.<EOL>
We would also reiterate our commitment to a tax on financial transactions based on the model of the Tobin tax.<EOL>
I believe that the picture painted by the budget is a little paradoxical, since we have been obliged to accept to be blackmailed by the Council in respect of the structural funds.<EOL>
   The report is just the European Parliament’s own take on the matter concerned and involves no legislative procedure.<EOL>
What Parliament is proposing in view of the lack of coherence, the contradictions and the discriminations that we find in the Commission's proposal, is something as simple as a single legal framework, a horizontal regulation within the framework of national programmes with the aim of maintaining the coherence necessary to fulfil the objectives of the common fisheries policy.<EOL>
The instruments of EU cohesion policy are managed in a common framework that ranges from the strategic guidelines to payments and the submission of reports.<EOL>
If I may mention just a couple of courses of action, proposals have been made for funding the conversion of the European Police College into a European institution for training senior police officers, and the network of national training institutes is to be built up.<EOL>
By contrast, the foreign policy of the Spanish Government has set a good example, as through constructive, exacting dialogue, a considerable number of prisoners of conscience have been released.<EOL>
The threat of withholding Structural Funds in the event of non-implementation is an attempt by the Commission to put pressure on the Member States and is undoubtedly the wrong approach since stopping the payment of Structural Funds due to non-implementation also carries the risk that on-going projects may be jeopardised, thereby stopping or jeopardising the economic development of a region in general.<EOL>
Of course, the Commissioner does not have an easy job: first Commissioner Fischler wants to give the wrong food aid again, then Member States grant Mr Lamy insufficient support when he wants to give extra aid to 48 countries.<EOL>
Let me draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has today decided that we will carry out a reform of the tobacco sector, which will result in these financial resources being completely decoupled.<EOL>
Although the situation varies from country to country, there are, in fact, a number of countries in which 20-30% of the active population is infected.<EOL>
We all know that Europe is hanging in the balance at present as regards reform and greater efficiency of Institutional procedure.<EOL>
I am also happy that standing committees have been set up.<EOL>
Recently, there have been negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and some of the issues that have been debated include a massive erosion of individual civil liberties.<EOL>
However, I think that we will see an overwhelming majority from all the political groups behind his proposal not to grant discharge tomorrow, and I welcome that.<EOL>
I think it would be a mistake to send them this message.<EOL>
It must be stressed that cohesion policy has had the positive effect of reducing the existing disparities between the Member States, as regards cohesion and other aspects.<EOL>
It has even postponed negotiations with Russia over energy security.<EOL>
The situation is that market access can be structured on an objective, non-discriminatory and transparent basis.<EOL>
It is now tighter in our proposal.<EOL>
Mr President, there is much room for improvement regarding current mechanisms for preventing natural and man-made disasters.<EOL>
Why demand more of the European institutions, therefore, than you demand of your own national institutions?<EOL>
Community Transit System<EOL>
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Grässle, for her important work within the framework of these reports, which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies.<EOL>
Do you not think that, without a strong role for the Arab League, such action would send out an extremely negative signal to that enormous population – which unfortunately harbours the most fundamentalist ideas in the world?<EOL>
As I have been saying for the last five years, we have to find better ways of getting ministers who sign up to these agreements to keep to their word.<EOL>
Such commodities are a lifeblood for countries and we know the obligations and responsibilities that we have to such countries.<EOL>
My one criticism of this agreement, seen from the point of view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is that it is so detailed and is broken down into so many points that it takes much of the flexibility away from the annual budgetary procedure.<EOL>
It is a response to the practical problem which arose in consequence of Opinion 1/03 of the European Court of Justice on the new Lugano Convention, in accordance with which the Communities are competent to conclude external agreements to the same extent that they used the mandate to accept legal means in the area of judicial cooperation in civil cases under Article 61(c) of the EC Treaty.<EOL>
The world is an electronic casino, where the stakes are the various products of the stock exchange.<EOL>
First, the inclusion of the rights of the child in the Treaty has occurred indirectly by the mentioning in the Treaty of Amsterdam of the basic social rights and the provision in policy measures against discrimination on the basis of age, social exclusion, trading in people and offences against children.<EOL>
Not that I fail to appreciate the social and economic conditions underlying this shift to the right and this xenophobia, but be in no doubt that the centralised imposition of rules - in which no account is taken of the attitude of the local community - is downright fatal and fosters right-wing extremism.<EOL>
The huge number of redundancies in some of the largest companies in the European Union proves that it is not just speculative use by large investors that harms the working classes and society - it is capital full stop as well as the economic system, which is driven by profit and the capitalist thirst for making money.<EOL>
The Commission’s Work Programme is a rather similar case, where one cannot see the wood for the trees.<EOL>
We support the amendments that automatically couple the future distribution of seats to the populations of the Member States.<EOL>
But it would certainly serve as a very good instrument and good indicator that those who register are prepared to respect the rules and be transparent, that they have nothing to hide and - this should be the key indicator for all of us - that they should be real partners to work with us and exchange information with us and that they have trust in our future communication.<EOL>
One thing at stake is what the concentration of resources means, and what the consequences may be for the people of Europe.<EOL>
It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system.<EOL>
It has been stated in this Chamber that the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is a matter of urgency.<EOL>
Germany has already announced that it is going to halt operations at a number of power stations.<EOL>
However, in order for this adventure, which stemmed from the bad news of the collapse of GM in the United States, to be an opportunity to build a solvent, modern, competitive business with a clear future from a company, economic and technological point of view, the Commission and the Commissioners themselves need to take the lead again in the current negotiations in order to ensure that we achieve a truly European solution with all possible guarantees.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, over the last ten years, European public opinion has gradually become aware of the fact that the European Union needs to have its own defence system in order to enable it to have influence, political influence on world affairs, which should be acquired from its moral authority and its economic power.<EOL>
It ultimately transpired that the blame lay with credit companies which, once they had finished playing games on Nasdaq and the bubbles on the property market had burst, turned their attention to government debt and prices for basic foodstuffs, for the purpose of speculation.<EOL>
Violence will not be abandoned as the result of conferences, talks and visits, especially when international obligations are breached in the process, nor will it be abandoned by giving into the temptation of the old colonising forces and granting armed forces from any one ethnic group favoured status.<EOL>
In Denmark, the water supply is owned by the consumer and managed locally, and those are very important prerequisites for being able to guarantee that water sources and the environment continue to be protected.<EOL>
We therefore need to see, from the Commission's side, what actions need to be taken to inform consumers.<EOL>
I voted against this text.<EOL>
If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well.<EOL>
Thirdly, and finally, in February 1997 the Council adopted a joint action in order to criminalise trafficking in human beings.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
In fact, the monitoring, registration and handling of chemical products and substances must be covered by a set of rules that is clear, easy to understand and appropriate to the purposes for which the use of such products is intended.<EOL>
Unfortunately, although indispensable, common action often comes slowly and with difficulty, because members prefer the individual approach.<EOL>
The conclusions of this meeting should be based on scientific knowledge and the precautionary principle.<EOL>
Opposite that is the problem of media concentration; in my view this has to be resolved quickly by legislation, which we are awaiting.<EOL>
author. - Mr President, I frankly and fully acknowledge that these two oral questions tabled on 1 December last year have been overtaken by events, but this debate is still worthwhile to acknowledge that the issue of procedural rights is fully back on the table after a regrettable absence of several years and to stress the urgency and priority of this programme.<EOL>
We submitted our proposals in June, and they were given a favourable reception at the informal ministerial debate held in July by the Swedish Presidency.<EOL>
The Vaxholm judgment gave three unequivocal answers: firstly, that the Member States may not decide on labour-market matters; secondly, that employees may not resort to disputes which disrupt the internal market - thus the Court takes away from workers their only effective means of defending the principle of equal pay for equal work; thirdly, companies which establish themselves in EU countries with lower levels of pay get the right to send employees to other countries to work for the same low wages.<EOL>
I also agree with Mrs Guinebertière's recommendations. One of Mr Van Velzen's points is, I think, very important.<EOL>
It would be rational management of the issue if Europe were to release resources now, to be given to Greece in the future and used by it to develop the Greek economy.<EOL>
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.<EOL>
As we have been seeing, unequal societies are unstable societies.<EOL>
5.<EOL>
I am voting in favour of this report in the hope of finally witnessing the decommissioning of the Kozloduy reactors.<EOL>
Perhaps if our citizens were aware of this - I think they are not - they might think twice about their purchasing and disposal methods.<EOL>
Consumers confuse the designation of the place where food is processed with the place of origin of the agricultural product.<EOL>
To these can also now be added the unfortunate proceedings against a Commission official, as mentioned previously.<EOL>
An area of freedom, justice and security requires increased legal certainty and a strengthening of individual fundamental rights that the European Court of Justice can and must apply.<EOL>
What are the criteria and mechanisms for allocating these resources?<EOL>
It is worrying that Renault is moving it production from Slovenia to France.<EOL>
As far as the results of the March referendum are concerned, we note with satisfaction that, despite the particularly difficult situation, the ballot was held without any violent episodes being reported.<EOL>
The statements by the new Commissioners designate confirm our estimation that they will serve the interests of big business with passion.<EOL>
In most countries, there has been a change in the conditions that prevailed until some time ago, whereby many more women were engaged in precarious work.<EOL>
The CEO of the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world EADS has actually bemoaned the fact that the US already invests six times more than Europe in armaments research and that while the research budgets in the US continue to rise, those in Europe stagnate.<EOL>
Important events took place at those meetings, such as the general report on globalisation, the hearing on AIDS and the notable presence of President Josselin and of Commissioners Lamy and Nielson.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a couple of minutes to clarify a few matters concerning the debate that took place today.<EOL>
Essentially, we need to ask whether the aim is actually to restrict the rights of the family in its traditional meaning, that is, mother, father and children.<EOL>
. (PT) This report comments favourably on the Commission' s proposal for an action plan on financial markets, the objective of which is to liberalise capital markets.<EOL>
This is a subject covered in the report on relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport.<EOL>
Moreover, the economic crisis should not ultimately turn into a crisis of values and principles.<EOL>
Mr President, I apologise for not being in the House when I was first called but my travel arrangements went rather awry today.<EOL>
In spite of the often discussed problem concerning the Roma community, we still have not found the most apt solutions which would lead to their lasting integration into society.<EOL>
We know that, beside the destruction of their habitats, international trade is the greatest threat to the survival of many endangered species.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, I would like to add just a few more comments.<EOL>
Mrs Peijs and others said that better solutions were found in the Netherlands and that is why people go there.<EOL>
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by Frederik A. Willockx, which is concerned with the relationship between EMU and the social security systems of the Member States of the European Union.<EOL>
That surely is important.<EOL>
This is very important for Europe's citizens: how to create a conducive environment so we can achieve positive results but prevent the possibility, on the market, of fixed prices.<EOL>
With its educational, democratic, cultural, social, integrative and health-promoting aspects, it has an enormous beneficial impact on our daily lives.<EOL>
I should like to make a couple of comments, however.<EOL>
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.<EOL>
However, my motion calling on the Commission to present proposals for combating the abuse of the asylum system throughout Europe was successful.<EOL>
The immunity of Mr Tomczak was raised by Parliament a few years ago.<EOL>
Thus Europe still has 49 ATC centres, 31 national systems, 18 hardware suppliers, 22 control systems and 30 programming languages.<EOL>
This company does not at the moment have export ambitions but the Official Journal gives it cheap, ready access to customers in public authorities to a standard format.<EOL>
As a result, research centres have moved to China and India.<EOL>
That is why it is important for us now to express our desire that Europe’s poorest country should have normal parliamentarian democracy, with equal rights and opportunities for all parties taking part in the elections on 6 March.<EOL>
Then there was the domestic political instability, which tarnished the image of the European Union or, in other words, of all of us.<EOL>
   Mr President, the Brok report on the fundamental choices of the CFSP is really extremely interesting and falls short only on one aspect: it fails to state that Europe consists of nations and that these nations, at least the larger ones, fully intend to continue to play their role on the world stage.<EOL>
People can then be confident that their social security rights travel with them, that their pensions are in order, regardless of where they are living or working, and that proper care is guaranteed, everywhere in Europe and not just for themselves but for their families too.<EOL>
The important thing about it is that it was intended to implement the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Flora and Fauna Directive, and to provide the financial means whereby this could be done.<EOL>
Commissioner, I would nonetheless like to ask you to reiterate the long list of activities that you have already undertaken so that my fellow Members can see that there is certainly no need for us to go crazy and start enacting numerous additional measures with the result that we destroy the sound progress that has been made.<EOL>
Fourthly, the ECU 60 million earmarked under the Interinstitutional Agreement is quite sufficient, as far as the Liberal Group is concerned.<EOL>
This is the era of globalisation.<EOL>
I think that in the case of confidential business information - and I gather that what is involved here is a report produced by a consultancy for Volvo, in other words entirely within the private sector - it is unwise to insist on publication of a report which the Commission has in its charge because of its responsibilities for competition law.<EOL>
The amendments proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I am now tabling, support the Commission in this action and I would ask for your approval of this report.<EOL>
The crisis in Albania, Madam President, is not a civil war.<EOL>
There was good coordination between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment.<EOL>
For that reason also, it is essential to conduct an in depth study of the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences for online music services and of the effects on the socio-economic situation of the rightholders and on cultural diversity.<EOL>
The Commission welcomes the willingness of the present government, albeit timid, to recognise the state's responsibility for past violations of human rights and to secure compensation for victims.<EOL>
We are all convinced that guarantee rules for all should be established at the international level, but we are still concerned, all the more so as the decision on this closer consultation between the European Union and the United States was part of an agreement which led to the suspension of the WTO panel when the United States was in the dock over its Helms-Burton Act.<EOL>
I will resume because there is no point in wasting time.<EOL>
Last week I met the Committee of British University Vice-Chancellors.<EOL>
Consequently, I find it particularly galling that French legislation appears to focus heavily on the artistic décor in relation to impossible corridors, lights and stairwells, and appears not to concern itself with energy conservation, whilst in my country, for example, at least a third of all new homes are equipped with solar panels.<EOL>
In 2007, in the euro zone, trade recorded a surplus of 28.3 billion euros, as compared to a deficit of 9.3 billion euros in 2006.<EOL>
This is a turnkey agreement which guarantees free market access and national treatment in more than 95 % of worldwide trade in financial services.<EOL>
Since 1999, the euro area has mostly been an area of economic stability.<EOL>
As for giving support to the Fiscalis Programme, which is aimed at improving the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market, we are training the officials required in each country because, as far as we are concerned, doing so will guarantee that the Union has a future and is secure and prosperous.<EOL>
For this reason, I cannot accept Amendments 19 or 23.<EOL>
in writing. - (SK) The enormous damage caused by the recent earthquakes and tsunami in Japan will not be cleared up overnight.<EOL>
In the general framework agreement with the Commission, we have a one-month deadline.<EOL>
But it is the Commission's job to step up pressure on the Member States, and we will be glad to help out.<EOL>
We are perhaps closing a window of opportunity, and we shall no doubt catch some small fry as a result – so much seems certain – but it is not the proper sharp instrument we need to combat terrorism. I am honestly convinced of that.<EOL>
Unfortunately, the beneficiaries of the research programmes use a number of national and EU sources of funding.<EOL>
I feel that the Parliament fully supports these proposals, and - despite listening carefully to Mr Frattini saying what is unacceptable to him and the Commission - I sincerely hope that the Council understands our many questions, since they could be the keys to how the Agency should carry out its work so as to focus on real problems.<EOL>
For this partnership to be sound and genuine, Russia needs to understand the nature of the EU, and the EU ought to help it to do so.<EOL>
(ES) Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso - who is not here, but whom I am also addressing - the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important.<EOL>
Key priorities, such as transparency and consumer protection, will be pursued, while a bank crisis framework will aim to prevent and tackle future crises.<EOL>
She spoke of EU traceability from farm to table, but she also told us that in third countries, the scope of traceability is much more limited.<EOL>
These cooperatives must be able to extend their activities to European level and to be able to do so within a certain legal framework, which safeguards their specific nature, both in terms of the primacy of the individual and the objects of the undertaking on capital, and in terms of participation in the general interest and social cohesion.<EOL>
That concludes voting time.<EOL>
We cannot afford to allow that to continue to happen.<EOL>
I would just like to tell Mr Helmer that the officials are currently working to put the British flag back.<EOL>
<EOL>
We are particularly worried about the government-controlled corrupt judicial and police systems which operate in the country, and call on the Ethiopian authorities to proceed immediately to drastic changes and corrective measures in order to remedy the currently abysmal situation and to show the outside world that they genuinely care about justice and democracy, instead of simply claiming to do so.<EOL>
Despite recent successes with regard to Libya and Iran, there is little cause for optimism.<EOL>
I voted against the discharge because, in my view, this money can be spent more effectively than in a poorly operating agency.<EOL>
Thirdly, and vitally, Member States need to put in place upfront funding for energy-efficiency improvements and, despite all the work of the rapporteur and the shadows' best efforts, we did not get as far on this in the recast as we would have wished from Parliament's point of view.<EOL>
How can you achieve this with just a handful of officials in the Commission?<EOL>
Discarding is one of the obscene outcomes of the Common Fisheries Policy and many other fishing management regimes - it is not unique to our own.<EOL>
Commissioner Barroso said in Cork that the Lisbon Treaty would bring the EU closer to its citizens.<EOL>
The so-called second strong, sturdy leg or the second pillar, as the Commission says, in policy for rural areas is a very narrow support to which a heck of a lot of flesh has to be added.<EOL>
I am afraid I have to say that there is to some degree a lack of drive in this work programme.<EOL>
It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens.<EOL>
The EU is one of the main providers of assistance in the reconstruction work following the civil war in Sudan.<EOL>
What is more, our Western allies in the fight against Germany were also allies of the Soviet Union, and gave their consent to our enslavement in Yalta.<EOL>
This practice has proven effective and transparent in implementing the Global Fund's stated policy of zero tolerance of corruption.<EOL>
When we signed an Association Agreement with Turkey in 1963, which offered the prospect of membership, the European Union did not exist; at that time, we were still the European Economic Community.<EOL>
On this basis, EU institutions would take effective measures and would demand the same of national governments.<EOL>
Attached to the Communication is a special annex entitled 'Forest Fires'; this refers to the great, catastrophic fires that struck southern Europe, and Greece in particular, last summer.<EOL>
However, we should bear in mind that international arrest warrants issued by Interpol are not by themselves binding upon the state that receives them.<EOL>
That is a summary of this Europe that the people of France and the Netherlands rejected last year during the referendums on the European Constitution.<EOL>
I believe that that summit also affords us a good opportunity to make headway on the issues of visa relaxations and the arrangements for the return of immigrants, and will enable further progress to be achieved over the coming year as regards the partnership and cooperation agreement, which is needed in order to put our partnership on a firm footing, to develop the four-area-strategy, and achieve results in energy security in particular, for Russia too must know that the partnership is possible only if it recognises not only the freedom of all nations in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond, but also that they may not be allowed to become victims on other grounds.<EOL>
Similarly, the Commission proposal makes no provision whatsoever to harmonise value added tax, which fluctuates from one Member State to another by as much as 100%.<EOL>
In this context, as in others, dealing with practical reality cuts across geopolitical borders.<EOL>
   Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike many Members, I wish to point out that, in the course of our deliberations, all – or at any rate, most – of us have agreed that we want patents in the field of computer-implemented inventions, and that our European industry’s great strength is dependent on us getting them.<EOL>
The Council was asked as long as a month or so ago to be present without fail at this debate, and we were even promised that it would be.<EOL>
The results of this study will enable the Commission to decide on an appropriate way forward.<EOL>
When does the Commission think it will get around to doing something about this, or does it hope to divert us from the really important issues by submitting technical questions?<EOL>
There are still unjustified, unacceptable gaps between regions, and between the group of the poorest regions and the group of the richest regions.<EOL>
Therefore, there is no need to hurry into something that is legally questionable and leaves each country to its own devices when negotiating with the United States.<EOL>
We do not give people the opportunity to see a parliament in which there is a real conflict of opinions, and that is of course a pity, for we do in fact have a parliament in which, in the committees, we have quite lively and spontaneous debates.<EOL>
A court made a decision on this case, but he was given information about the court appearance after the date.<EOL>
Without progress on these issues, there can be no conclusion to the Round.<EOL>
We propose instead that each individual national parliament choose its own Commissioner and hold him or her responsible.<EOL>
This is why, Baroness Ashton, I think that today you have been given many incentives for the development of a more constructive and a more effective European Union policy.<EOL>
They will all be passed on to the President of Parliament.<EOL>
The rating agencies - Mr Rasmussen and Mr Lehne have already pointed this out - must close the gaps in information and disclose conflicts of interest.<EOL>
Certain aspects of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of America) process are also giving cause for concern.<EOL>
They prevent the future citizens of the European Union from seeing and appreciating everything that we have achieved in Europe together, and from meeting and befriending other Europeans of their age group.<EOL>
We therefore demand full involvement in its implementation.<EOL>
Thus, while we cannot achieve everything at once, we must pay special attention to the introduction of the euro, which means that we have to harmonize the taxation of savings and interest. When the currency is the same it makes no difference whether, for example, the money is deposited in one country or another, because the countries with the lowest tax rates will naturally benefit and transfers are therefore to be expected.<EOL>
The essential problem has something to do with our view of the economy which is opposed to that of the United States, especially when such an important country allows it decisions to be dictated by an utterly unscrupulous company.<EOL>
Madam President, you know very well, as do all the Members of the Bureau, that no decision has been taken and that no proposal has been submitted so far.<EOL>
It is of paramount importance that exchanges of information be governed by transparency and trust between all of those involved in the process.<EOL>
These problems are not those of a minority in Europe. No, Europe' s shortcomings in these areas are particularly sensitive issues on the national borders.<EOL>
Public Transport is a national and regional matter.<EOL>
The Commission will also in the weeks to come formally transmit a response to the European Parliament's written declaration on investigating and remedying the abuse of power by large supermarkets in the EU.<EOL>
Neither effectiveness nor justice benefit from this state of affairs.<EOL>
The vote was taken, the result was announced, and that is what is valid.<EOL>
The right to education accorded them in Vienna is also made largely impossible for them to exercise; in Karpasia at the present time, one teacher is teaching all the children of every age group, there are no secondary schools, and boys and girls who attend school in the free part of Cyprus are not allowed to return home once they reach the ages of 16 and 18 respectively.<EOL>
The Committee on Fisheries also adopted the suggestion made by the Council of Ministers regarding adjustment of the margin of error in fishing log book entries from 8% to 10%.<EOL>
Thus there is clearly greater demand for the control of trihalomethane - I would draw your attention to the fact that there are a number of systems where no such analyses are carried out -, and for the long-term replacement of lead pipes.<EOL>
With today's decision the European Parliament allocated EUR 175 million towards the construction of an energy bridge, which will link Lithuania and Sweden.<EOL>
We have seen other outbreaks in other countries recently.<EOL>
Mr President, I have three observations to make.<EOL>
If the Commission had been able to propose a clear legal response to you today, this would mean that a solution had been found to the problem we have been debating.<EOL>
To Amendment No 5, we would simply propose a small correction in terms of style and that is, instead of the phrase appearing after the reference to the International Monetary Fund, we believe it should appear immediately after the word "Commission" .<EOL>
On sustainable consumption and production, the EU has been playing a leading role by promoting a broad mix of policies and tools, such as integrated pollution prevention and control, the eco-management and audit scheme and eco-labelling, as well as sectoral instruments in key areas such as energy or agriculture.<EOL>
We heard from Mr Prodi, when he took up his position as President of the Commission, that there would be political accountability.<EOL>
Proper planning and coordination, combined with effective but fair policing has demonstrated that many similar sporting events can take place without any such problems.<EOL>
Compliance with the deadline is conditional on the deployment of the new generation Schengen Information System, SIS II.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr Deva's report concerns the eradication of poverty and food security.<EOL>
This is the great challenge for the European institutions and for European politics.<EOL>
Mrs Wallis took on the heavy burden of convincing the Commission of the need for amendments to the legal basis.<EOL>
the stress tests should be evaluated on technical grounds and not on political grounds or grounds which leave room for speculation;<EOL>
   .– The hypocritical bombast about 'legitimacy', 'compromise' and 'democratic procedures' being bandied about in the European Parliament by the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council cannot hide the undisguised and despicable interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine and the suppression of any concept of national independence.<EOL>
As Mrs Halonen said, it is probable that people in the region are also guilty of crimes that violate international human rights.<EOL>
I did so because it is always important to remind people that transparency is key to democracy, because the path to gaining access to European Union information is still too often full of pitfalls for the average citizen, and also because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, on 1 December, significantly alters the situation.<EOL>
I salute and thank you for that.<EOL>
I therefore hope that proposed Amendment No 19 to Article 7(1) second indent will be adopted by the entire House.<EOL>
Fine words from our government are all very well, but what we now need is action.<EOL>
Regional problems can be solved.<EOL>
Subject: Turkish threats over installation of missiles on Cyprus<EOL>
As a result, we must ask once again: what is the Council' s position on the necessary communitisation of fishing rights in European Union waters in accordance with the principles laid down in the Treaties?<EOL>
The second risk is that all the problems with the horizontal regulation of the CAP - modulation, the definition of a maximum amount, cross compliance - will end up being a lost opportunity.<EOL>
We have supply and demand, and there are certain things that are sought in Europe, and which have always been sought in Europe, and not in the United States, and vice versa. It is important that this European decision, which will hopefully be taken by a majority of us tomorrow, should exert enormous pressure in favour of representatives campaigning for resale rights in Switzerland and also in the United States.<EOL>
Norwegian salmon dumping<EOL>
A high grade of biodiversity is crucial for a healthy living environment, for food security and for quality of life in general.<EOL>
This remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture.<EOL>
With regard to safety conditions for children less than 12 years old, I believe, like the rapporteur, that it is more logical to take their height into account rather than their weight, because they do not need special restraints if they are at least 150 cm tall.<EOL>
I believe that that too is, and will be, an important element in the further development of our common policy.<EOL>
Turkey does not belong to Europe and never will.<EOL>
The amount of credit taken across borders is not sufficient to justify harmonisation, but may I suggest that the European Union itself is running out of credit with citizens because it refuses to take the necessary action, through referendums, to legitimise itself?<EOL>
He therefore did not need to start talking about new nuclear plants at the end of a statement on a report which describes how decommissioning is gathering pace around the world.<EOL>
It is an anomaly that we are having to discuss the pressing needs of enlargement at a time when, technically, we cannot consider the budget that we know must be used for that purpose post 2004.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado, I would like once again to remind you that I have given very concrete answers, both to the problem and also to the steps which the Commission has taken with regard to it.<EOL>
The ASCEA and JAMA commitments cover over 95 percent of the market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the EU.<EOL>
I appreciate that.<EOL>
It is stating the obvious to say that the Association of South East Asian Nations is a collection of ten countries with particularly diverse levels of development, both politically and economically, as our rapporteur has just said.<EOL>
The permanent grubbing-up of these illegal vines would allow a measure of balance to be restored.<EOL>
We should remember that countries in which public control is not working - ...<EOL>
I sense a very positive feeling about proceeding with the final vote and decision.<EOL>
I am particularly glad because it emphasises the fact that scientists agree on the seriousness of this problem.<EOL>
Only then will it earn the same high reputation as the Deutsche Bundesbank has in my country.<EOL>
Yet it is a religion, ladies and gentlemen, which has lost its god, for the Community method that you are all upholding was based on the centrality of the Commission, and the Commission no longer has that pivotal status.<EOL>
The current position represents a careful balance between what is environmentally desirable, technically feasible and economically achievable.<EOL>
Personally I do not want the European Union to negotiate agreements with anyone on anything.<EOL>
<EOL>
To begin with, I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because my criticisms of the Constitution outnumber by far the very few aspects of it which could be regarded as slight progress.<EOL>
Feng Sakchittaphong actually said in court: ' I want the democratic change to occur in a peaceful way without street demonstrations, without confrontation and without overthrow' .<EOL>
Our condemnation of the attacks is fair and necessary, but insufficient: the principle of reciprocity does not appear in this resolution.<EOL>
I am glad that the report emphasises the necessity of regarding those in especially disadvantaged situations, such as the Roma, because the increasing exclusion of the Roma and their segregation in schools is typically a new Member State phenomenon.<EOL>
In the internal market procedure, why should there be a difference?<EOL>
Among other things, we would like to see a reduction in the proportion of the EU budget allocated to agricultural policy, the retention and development of cross-compliance and the adaptation of the system to the market.<EOL>
These are the very specific points that are mentioned in the report.<EOL>
Such a state of affairs should be avoided where possible and certain states, which blatantly violate human rights, should not feel more equal than others.<EOL>
Of course I can understand Mrs Rühle's criticism of the level of ambition, but at the same time the work in our Parliament focuses on reaching reasonable compromises - something the Commissioner also mentioned - which can be implemented throughout our Union.<EOL>
I also know, however, that group discipline sometimes imposes views that are not the right ones.<EOL>
We know why it happened.<EOL>
It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive.<EOL>
The report also includes some other proposals.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, and of President Barroso, I should like to make a few comments about the 2020 strategy and echo the very interesting reports from Mr Grech and Mr Hoang Ngoc; next, my colleagues and friends, Commissioners Hahn and Andor, will speak in turn - in this debate in which we are participating - on the other oral questions which affect other sectors: cohesion, employment, the social dimension, research and development.<EOL>
In 2011, we will be working on many important subjects, such as the directive on consumer rights, legislation in the field of financial services and intellectual property and preparations for the future 2014-2020 financial perspective.<EOL>
The Health Check will now confirm the validity of this twofold objective.<EOL>
However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is already covered in Article 11, section 1.<EOL>
It is a measure of the consequences of vaccination that the UK has not yet decided if it will avail itself of the Commission decision in the circumstances in which it has been requested.<EOL>
I am grateful to this House for the understanding for minorities that has been forthcoming.<EOL>
Our fellow citizens, however, wish to see a Europe that provides solutions to the challenges of globalisation.<EOL>
Coming from Finland, I think it very important that we do not just focus on GDP but broaden our view and look at how difficult it is to get to a place.<EOL>
Mr President, I know Mr Leinen to be an upright and honourable colleague.<EOL>
I think that we should do away with the register.<EOL>
The proposal would therefore not affect the safety or quality of spare parts.<EOL>
However, the European Parliament and the Council rejected the Commission's proposals by a large majority.<EOL>
The signing of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU has taken place 13 years after the end of the war. 'The agreement offers an open door to a prosperous future for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina while, at the same time, it calls on Bosnian politicians to leave the past behind them and move on,' stated Sven Alkalaj, the country's foreign minister, at one time.<EOL>
The absence of rapporteurs from debates is something that must be pointed out.<EOL>
We want no more than that, which is why we ask Turkey not to misunderstand these efforts that the European Parliament is making.<EOL>
Secondly, it became apparent from hearings and from numerous studies that cumulative fatigue in pilots as a result of inappropriate scheduling was a problem in need of further investigation even after the result we have achieved, and the Council has proposed that this problem be put back on the agenda in three years’ time.<EOL>
Mutual confidence cannot be brought about by decree.<EOL>
The opposite is the case.<EOL>
Mr President, I congratulate my friend and colleague Mr Arvidsson on attempting to make sense of this draft directive.<EOL>
One of the three - English, French or German - will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout the EU.<EOL>
If action is taken against European companies we certainly will do so.<EOL>
Obviously, the aim is to further employment prospects through increased competitiveness and social cohesion in a stable macroeconomic environment.<EOL>
It is therefore important to strengthen European cooperation in the struggle against unfair practices in advertising through a process of coregulation that can improve the efficacy and applicability of measures.<EOL>
The US Secretary of State has not agreed to anything, unless the Council has received information which is different from the information given to Parliament.<EOL>
   I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.<EOL>
On the other hand, I do think that the industry should not expect too much from Europe, but that the industry itself and the Member States will have to make the necessary adjustments.<EOL>
On the invitation of the Nigerian authorities, the Commission fielded a large independent election observation mission (EOM), which performed well and cooperated closely with other international and domestic observer groups.<EOL>
It is true that there is a significant lack of freedom of information in Italy, particularly because the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has brought the majority of the television channels directly or indirectly into his sphere of influence as a result of his political position and his media empire.<EOL>
You have attached great importance to transparency, and so I have two questions.<EOL>
I should like to emphasize three profoundly innovative aspects of the policies of cooperation and support for development:<EOL>
May we never forget to take account of the will of the people and not of certain ideals, which, noble and grand as they may be, are not shared by citizens and voters.<EOL>
For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently.<EOL>
I therefore consider it necessary to strengthen individual programmes at the Member State level, and also to boost the resources of the EU and the European Investment Bank focused on innovative financial instruments.<EOL>
I can only underline that, whatever method is chosen, it will need to be a bilateral agreement between the two countries, Slovenia and Croatia.<EOL>
I am sorry.<EOL>
Its calls for the codecision procedure to apply to the CAP would certainly increase Parliament's powers, but have nothing to do with the BSE problem.<EOL>
Children who are left to their own devices in problem families imitate the models they see promoted in the media.<EOL>
If health really is one of the priorities of the European Union's development policy, then the Member States should make a firm commitment to grant the mandatory licences developing countries need if they are to protect their public health.<EOL>
As the democratically elected representatives of Europe, we have it in our power to establish a day on which to honour their memory.<EOL>
a decent European Parliament must reflect the wider diversity of political opinion that we find in the Union: we need not copy exactly national parliaments whose job is to supply a government;<EOL>
According to Amnesty International (AMR 25/29/97/S) the first 12 signatories were visited by the police, who warned them that they were risking long prison sentences.<EOL>
I expect the Swedish Presidency to support us in our endeavour to remedy these weaknesses of Nice and to strengthen the legitimacy of democratic decisions in the European Union again, and I am convinced it will do so.<EOL>
That concludes the explanations of vote.<EOL>
This is clearly in everyone's interests, but to achieve that, we need trust and that trust must be restored.<EOL>
Let me say right away that, while we recognise the strength of feeling on this matter, there is no support in the Council for such drastic action, because we believe this would risk harming the very people we are trying to help – the poorest and most vulnerable people.<EOL>
There is no mention of the threat in this report.<EOL>
I am grateful to Mr Collins for having accepted many of the amendments that we tabled to his report, because I feel it has been genuinely useful to include them.<EOL>
I should also like to welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has adopted the main amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets.<EOL>
We cannot afford to waste any time, and in many projects we need to speed the process of disbursement and implementation.<EOL>
That is why it is right to regard this as a matter of economic policy of common interest; hence the burden sharing negotiations.<EOL>
It is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the Treaty refers to session weeks.<EOL>
It makes no sense in terms of Realpolitik for us to be more demanding in some areas than in others, for us to be more indulgent of some states than of others, and for us to pursue cooperation policies with some states that do not respect fundamental human rights, and where the rule of law has broken down and serious transgressions go unpunished.<EOL>
Who are we then to criticise what is happening now, but we do have grave doubts about the way in which this has been organised.<EOL>
The Commission shares the view that improved cooperation at European level is crucial to manage immigration flows.<EOL>
The EUR 2 405 671 mobilised from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will fund a coordinated package of personalised services, which will be supplemented by national measures and measures taken by the company.<EOL>
I am quite sceptical in relation to the system used to date.<EOL>
Mr President, honourable Members, my conviction is that research and innovation are not an option for Europe, but a necessity if we want a long-term solution that protects our social model and the sustainability of our environment.<EOL>
(EL) Surely the title of the report under discussion - safe and sustainable pensions - is meant euphemistically, given that it is obvious both from the spirit and the letter of the report that its concern is for companies and employers and to radically dismantle social security and pensions in a way best in keeping with interests of big business.<EOL>
The main aim of the proposed legislation is to establish limit values for atmospheric concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in order to improve the quality of our air and to avoid, prevent and reduce the adverse effects of these substances on human health and the environment.<EOL>
Mr Jerzy Buzek<EOL>
I would like to repeat again here that the key responsibility in the area of mandatory indications of origin for poultry meat lies with the Commission and not with the Council.<EOL>
I really do believe that it is possible for any Member State to be faced with a disproportionate share of the burden, and I should like to say this to our Spanish Members, amongst others: it is actually not the case that this issue only concerns Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and one or two other countries.<EOL>
To achieve that, I believe that the economic policy guidelines must be coordinated with employment strategy, and therefore the euro is - and remains at this historic moment in the construction of Europe - the main and most appropriate response.<EOL>
I believe an awareness deficit is no longer the problem, certainly not among decision-makers.<EOL>
The Commission is obliged to the Council and the German Presidency for the far-reaching, bold objectives set at last week's European Council.<EOL>
As you know, committees do not normally hold meetings at the same time as a plenary session, but I believe it can be justified in this case given the exceptional circumstances.<EOL>
I should like to touch on an issue that also concerns other countries.<EOL>
I congratulate Taiwanese President Ma on his new successful policy of rapprochement between Beijing and Taipei, and at last the PRC has seen the folly of its bullying ways towards its neighbour.<EOL>
We also agreed a new partnership with India.<EOL>
Thank you.<EOL>
This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence, but, ladies and gentlemen, if you give up a specific definition of chocolate, then at least do so clearly and openly.<EOL>
Should they be thrown overboard or taken somewhere?<EOL>
If we want the EU to remain a relevant global player, a European monetary fund and a European rating agency should be created.<EOL>
You should put more pressure on the Member States to ensure that this regulation is implemented more effectively, instead of coming up with new ideas about deregulation and competition.<EOL>
On the other hand, at the same time, the Heads of State and Government decided to disregard the implications of the Irish 'no' vote at the latest referendum.<EOL>
I think we should avoid a more or less useless debate on host versus home state control.<EOL>
The Commission is totally ignoring this.<EOL>
Then we shall move to the vote, as planned.<EOL>
This exception is substantially due to the existing issues regarding the recognition of that country's independence, which I hope can soon be resolved.<EOL>
I must first mention the recurring question of comitology.<EOL>
Parliament has always held a clear, responsible position on terrorism and cross-border crime.<EOL>
Another example is Newcastle disease, which is endemic in wild birds and could be transmitted to unvaccinated poultry at any time.<EOL>
Yet Sweden remains outside the euro, something that will be costly to us Swedes both economically and, not least, politically.<EOL>
Hence the importance of engaging in research that seeks to provide a better understanding of the functioning of terrestrial and marine ecosystems.<EOL>
Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 require skippers to record in their logbook the species and quantities of fish discarded, something which is not only an additional constraint but also totally unworkable.<EOL>
The safety of the citizens and the survival of thousands of European SMEs are at stake.<EOL>
I should like to draw attention to one particular aspect which concerns European industry: leaving aside prostitution networks, the overwhelming majority of children sold into slavery in Africa end up in cocoa plantations which produce the raw material for the European and international chocolate industry.<EOL>
So for pity’s sake, gentlemen, since we are coming to the end of this legislative term, open your eyes, rub the scales from them and face up to reality!<EOL>
The first was very simple: has the Dutch presidency scheduled for the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in April an initial assessment of the revision of the financial perspectives, with a view to the financing of the European Union in the post-1999 period?<EOL>
But you see, in all these agreements a problem occurs: either negotiations are delayed or some obstacle prevents subsequent ratification of the agreement reached.<EOL>
In the EU Gazprom is treated as a company that has a complete pipeline monopoly in production and transport.<EOL>
There are many misconceptions about this technique.<EOL>
Thank you for this debate.<EOL>
Over the years, many Commissioners have promised the earth in this area, and nothing has happened.<EOL>
That should not be done.<EOL>
The European Union should do the same.<EOL>
The third point is that which gives legal certainty and which, when implemented, helps to ensure that identical decisions are taken in all Member States.<EOL>
I have not voted in favour of Mr Callanan's report, despite the fact that it is well-founded and represents a move in the right direction.<EOL>
Gothenburg must be geared towards action, with clearly defined targets and timetables.<EOL>
If the European Union were to join them in this, that would be a noble endeavour.<EOL>
–That concludes the vote.<EOL>
Therefore, section 37 is central to this debate.<EOL>
To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection.<EOL>
Mr President, there has thankfully been a change in European Community law over the last 30 years from freedom of movement of persons being seen as purely an economic issue - functional mobility - to it being seen as a personal right.<EOL>
I would prefer to see restrictions imposed on the industry's activities and clear rules established on how those activities should be carried out.<EOL>
The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 which established the ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency) and its duration, can only have my absolute support.<EOL>
Yesterday, when we debated this issue, I asked the President whether we might hold the debate in another way and perhaps obtain a more lively debate by my talking for four minutes and subsequently rounding off the debate with a further minute of my speaking time.<EOL>
(SV) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Groote, for his constructive work.<EOL>
It was tabled, after all, last December.<EOL>
I think it right to speak at length about the Member States' responsibility in receiving applications for asylum and about which Member State should process them.<EOL>
The Commission will promote the development of a port network and ensure the development of good supporting investments.<EOL>
As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown.<EOL>
All closer cooperation must be compatible with the objectives of the European Union which are shared by all Member States; 4.<EOL>
The debate was held not only for symbolic and anniversary reasons; it was a political choice by our committee to sound once again the alarm bell for principles, security and the protection of human rights, women's dignity and the image of Europe in the eyes of its citizens and in the eyes of the citizens of the entire world.<EOL>
The average figure for poor countries is 0.05 psychiatrists per 100 000 inhabitants.<EOL>
China’s economic strength is growing in most industries.<EOL>
As we know, the United States has already spent more than 100 billion dollars on its anti-missile defence system and is investing a further ten billion a year in the continuing development of the system.<EOL>
Our job is to improve the lives of consumers, certainly not to chase after the autonomous yearnings of some dreamer, or worse, some profiteer.<EOL>
In their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, I wish the Council and the Commission much wisdom and patience in treading a path that will put an end to the intolerable disenfranchisement of the indigenous people of the central highlands.<EOL>
Mr Jospin was a party to the memorandum of agreement, which accepted the date base scheme in its entirety.<EOL>
The Council's conclusions are very welcome.<EOL>
Europe is currently witnessing a globalisation of the world economy and its hitherto disparate markets.<EOL>
The international outcry and the action taken by the European Parliament, civil society and the media may have saved their lives at the eleventh hour, but the issue of violations of women's rights and blatant discrimination on the basis of sex remains.<EOL>
Then I should like to mention the jurisdiction.<EOL>
As long as there is less felling than growth, coal is stored in our forests and can therefore contribute to a reduction in excess carbon dioxide obtained through the burning of fossil fuels.<EOL>
Commissioner, this is precisely the problem.<EOL>
Anyway, let me thank you once again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you very much for your report and for the support in it for the Commission's policy.<EOL>
Another element I would like to point out is the one expressed in Amendment No 11.<EOL>
Why are we again accepting a brutal war by Russia against its own people?<EOL>
These include maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency, old age and loss of employment, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices.<EOL>
In other words, extending the system to asylum seekers automatically identifies refugees and immigrants as a whole with crime and illegality, which I think is quite unfair and goes beyond every concept of international law and respect for human rights as demanded in the Geneva Convention, the 50th anniversary of which we celebrated in this morning' s extended debate here in the European Parliament.<EOL>
This topic, this report by Mr Hökmark, fits that brief perfectly.<EOL>
The attacks on the United States did not occur on September 11, they occurred before then, and an attack upon one is arguably an attack upon all of us.<EOL>
One positive step would be to get the European Asylum Support Office up and running during this year, which can provide Member States with support in applying resettlement initiatives.<EOL>
In fairness, Mr Barroso has responded: he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns.<EOL>
The European Parliament resolved to ask Prime Minister Erdoğan to table direct discussions with the DTP and instead his response was more oppression, more police, more authoritarianism and more imprisonment.<EOL>
In other words, principles such as freedom, democracy, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.<EOL>
The European Union has a link with human rights; its true source of pride is neither the euro nor the market, but human dignity.<EOL>
The proposals in the report violate the principle of subsidiarity.<EOL>
There is another report out today which was an annual report from the Commission, referred to in today's Financial Times under the wonderful heading "Brussels demands labour reform".<EOL>
Secondly, we want incentives to be provided for initiatives, positive courses of action and policies for human resources to promote equality.<EOL>
In that situation, people destroyed vineyards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed pomegranate orchards and replaced them with poppies; people destroyed apricot orchards and replaced them with poppies, because poppies were easy to grow – there was not much need for irrigation – and easy to sell.<EOL>
That is why we must without fail support Zimbabwe's neighbours, so that appropriate aid can be provided on Zimbabwe's borders.<EOL>
We give orders, Europe pays!'<EOL>
The Green Group has pointed out that in the Dutch translation of this report, the expression 'sexuele geaardheid' should be considered replaced by the expression 'sexuele voorkeur' .<EOL>
We are in full agreement with you as regards its importance, but we are just waiting for the right moment to present the proposal, which must be discussed by everybody together.<EOL>
This is fine within the framework of the new CARA programme, but it is also particularly important that this should happen in two weeks' time, in conjunction with the Stability Pact.<EOL>
As you know, ten countries have been named, including Cyprus, with which we hope to complete negotiations by the end of this year.<EOL>
We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy also have an interest in highlighting and applauding the progress Turkey has made in the economic field in terms of the criteria established by the Union and, in particular, we wish to emphasise its compliance with the Community in fields such as energy policy, industrial policy, research and development and telecommunications.<EOL>
This is an important objective in order to create a clear regulatory framework and provide assistance to spouses of different nationalities.<EOL>
   Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.<EOL>
The balance which the Liberal Group seeks to ensure between tackling illegal migration and providing for a system of managed legal migration seems to be essentially there.<EOL>
This brute-force approach has but one aim: that of destroying any hope of a negotiated peace with, as a consequence, the construction of the Wall imposed as the only acceptable solution.<EOL>
(PL) Madam President, the promotion of human rights is the main pillar of the European Union's external policy.<EOL>
In recent years the European Union has committed increasing resources to election observation missions in ACP countries, but those of us who have acted as observers are acutely aware that a well-conducted election is only the very first step in the process of establishing good governance.<EOL>
He is very wise!<EOL>
Beyond that, users wishing to scan through a certain work or access a protected document in its entirety would be directed to private sites specialising in secure digital dissemination, where a number of options would be open to them in return for payment of a fair remuneration to the copyright holders.<EOL>
So, in practice, this document that regulates access for our fishing boats to Equatorial Guinea recognises that there is no control on how this kind of fishing should be carried out.<EOL>
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Feio for his cooperative efforts and the spirit of compromise with which he has imbued his report.<EOL>
I therefore support the European Commission's proposal for a directive intended to formalise the SAFA procedure in the Community.<EOL>
I understand that his reply has been held for some time 'awaiting signature' , presumably to ensure we should not see it before today's debate.<EOL>
This is a real opportunity for the Union: immigrant populations should instead take advantage of free movement and a welcome which enables them to participate in local life and have a reasonable income.<EOL>
This is a good thing, of course.<EOL>
I would really like to know what the Commission's position is on this Northern Dimension question.<EOL>
These proposals were addressed in Mrs Schierhuber' s report, on which the final vote on 16 May was postponed in accordance with Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.<EOL>
That is a big compliment, Matthias, for it is not every day that I praise Social Democrats.<EOL>
In the light of these considerations, we shall present a draft route map with timetables and/or an interim report by the month of June.<EOL>
We are told that 12.8 million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000.<EOL>
Mr President, the Council is clearly concerned about the internal conflicts in Georgia which still need to be resolved.<EOL>
The Gulag Archipelago continued to expand, and the number of lives it claimed can be compared to the number of Soviet citizens that fell in the war.<EOL>
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, for nearly 10 years the European Council has dragged its feet on transforming the EU code of conduct on arms transfer into a legally binding document.<EOL>
We first have to change what is no longer acceptable in our European Union, for example the way in which we produce meat.<EOL>
All I can do is to urgently ask the Commission again to treat these problems with the priority that they deserve.<EOL>
Yet how can we prevent disease in a society wracked by unemployment and poverty, in which we are witnessing the reappearance of diseases that we thought had been eradicated, like tuberculosis?<EOL>
In that spirit, I welcome the European Commission's intention to employ all means at its disposal to achieve progress. That is exactly what Kosovo needs.<EOL>
They are not good news for staff who hope to be promoted simply on the basis of the number of years spent behind their desk.<EOL>
Animals suffer as a result, and the call must now go out for animals to be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir.<EOL>
Equally essential is a better climate in which to do business.<EOL>
Are we trying to reduce CO2 emissions, or are we trying to reduce energy consumption?<EOL>
Mr President, the Baltic Sea region had the fastest economic growth in Europe before the communist revolution.<EOL>
This leadership and dynamism can be achieved only if you operate in tandem with the Member States, the regions and the social partners.<EOL>
Here too, in my view, the lack of personnel is crucial in that no one is there to act as a focal point.<EOL>
It was less than nine years ago, yet worlds away.<EOL>
Thank you very much.<EOL>
The issue of democratic control of Europol has also been recently debated in the Convention Working Group 'Freedom, security and justice'.<EOL>
It is important too that there be flexibility where temporary and atypical pollution takes place.<EOL>
(Statement abbreviated in accordance with Article 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure)<EOL>
Financing - the European Parliament recognises that the development cost of the programme is EUR 3.4 billion, assured by the budgetary authorities.<EOL>
Mr President, the specific programmes for implementing the Sixth Framework Programme deal with each thematic priority in detail, clarifying their content and certainly making them more effective.<EOL>
In fact, this is also what we agreed a few months ago when the regulation was amended.<EOL>
I am very afraid that this enlargement fatigue will in particular have repercussions on our Balkan policy.<EOL>
We all know what was decided in Brussels and, moreover, what was not.<EOL>
There have been a large number of these in recent years.<EOL>
The ECB approach has achieved a high degree of monetary policy predictability and has allowed long-term inflation expectations to be anchored at healthy levels.<EOL>
I feel, therefore, that the European emissions market has become more ambitious in environmental terms with this report.<EOL>
Nor is this a decision that can be made on religious grounds: referring to the comments made by certain honourable Members, I would say that it is my conviction that our Union, our Community, is based on law and on human rights; it can never be a Union based on any form of religious bias.<EOL>
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.<EOL>
I would also like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for his supportive own-initiative report on the action plan on organ donation and transplantation.<EOL>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can we define this directive?<EOL>
Buckingham Palace was a minute corner of whole footprint of Saddam Hussein's palaces.<EOL>
This time, however, the process is taking place under particularly unusual conditions.<EOL>
We must build on these successes, but we must be aware, too, of the extent of the challenges that lie ahead, especially those highlighted by Mr Brie: governance, insecurity, corruption and drugs, which go hand in hand and have a negative impact on the normal functioning of the institutions and the sustainable development of the country.<EOL>
It is on the great trading route of the Silk Road and has some of the best preserved Islamic architecture sites, some of which are buried beneath the desert.<EOL>
I think that it is high time to move away from these dilemmatic Manichaeisms and to make clear points concerning our wish to engage in a constructive and efficient dialogue with Russia.<EOL>
These include: asymmetry in tariff dismantling; a gradual approach concerning liberalisation - for example, the agriculture sector is starting only now once a reasonable period followed industrial liberalisation; and last but not least, the provision of significant aid in support of economic and structural reforms and of sustainable rural development, earlier through MEDA, currently through the new ENP instrument.<EOL>
This is what we are calling for.<EOL>
The Commission therefore welcomes the contributions by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, and undertakes to examine them constructively.<EOL>
In the case of passenger cars and minibuses, a frontal impact is typical.<EOL>
In my opinion, the next step must be to produce a work on the implementation of the security policy, a white paper on the security policy.<EOL>
You know what I am talking about, since Greece is one of the countries that has the most responsibilities in this sector.<EOL>
I should be pleased if this House would support this urgent matter so that we can achieve good cooperation with this important part of Europe.<EOL>
Despite the growth in jobs for women over the past ten years - and there have been many new jobs - we still have a major gap in the employment rates of men and women and a somewhat lesser one in the unemployment rates.<EOL>
Our decision should balance environmental concerns and the interests of the industry.<EOL>
If the European Parliament has a role to play, a mission to accomplish, over the next five years, it is indeed to reconcile the citizens with Europe.<EOL>
This is a European problem, which has to be settled by Europeans.<EOL>
The Russian mentality is completely different, as those who have always been Russia's neighbours, like many Central and Eastern European nations, can testify.<EOL>
In this way, citizens are protected from damage which they might sustain as a result of culpable and illegal delay in the transposition of a directive by a Member State, in which case the national courts have jurisdiction and may rule on compensation provided that, first, the Member State has engaged in illegal, infringing conduct, such as the delayed or incorrect transposition of a directive into national law and, secondly, there is a link of cause and effect between the Member State's conduct and the damage sustained.<EOL>
(FR) Madam President, Mr Vondra, Commissioner, Europe can do a great deal if it wants to but, to do so, it has to make the correct diagnosis: currently, however, it is under-estimating the crisis.<EOL>
If women, and men too, opt for family life and to have children, that should not prevent them from participating in working life.<EOL>
The report indicates that the transit system is on the verge of collapse, and that Europe is being swamped by an obdurate form of crime as never before.<EOL>
However, both of those regulatory systems are rooted in tradition, past practice, and I suspect that we in Europe would have no greater luck in telling the Americans how to reform their regulatory systems than the Americans would have if they came over here and told us how to run our regulatory systems.<EOL>
Under Mr Ahmadinejad, Iran has long been sending not just mass murderers to the gallows but also people who have committed acts that in developed countries receive much lighter punishments or are not even considered to be against the law.<EOL>
This means that violence is a global political problem of the first degree and must be tackled as such.<EOL>
One policeman was killed.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
That is true for all the tobacco-growing areas.<EOL>
The ALDE Group would like to develop a long-term partnership with Russia in all areas, but we cannot allow our partner to deviate from and thereby violate the principles of the rule of law and democracy.<EOL>
I believe that in our open society it is time we put an end to this.<EOL>
Nor does it sound as if one should be burning them at home in one' s backyard.<EOL>
Those whose role and prestige makes them a point of reference for such a huge public and for all the institutions - such as the European Central Bank, which has our confidence - cannot permit themselves even a minor imperfection, and still less can they say, "Do what I say, not what I do" while advocating price stability, management efficiency and the greatest possible rectitude and transparency.<EOL>
<EOL>
This should be a minimum requirement which must be met, and which guarantees that quality in our places of higher education does not decrease, but improves wherever possible.<EOL>
I hope that such synergies will result in more efficient border controls - particularly since Frontex has no external officers of its own in third countries.<EOL>
We believe it is possible, and that is why we have put forward these proposals and also why we maintain that the environmental legislation must be observed at the same time that we have sensible agriculture in Europe.<EOL>
(SK) The report states that the Intelligent Car Initiative cannot be fully accomplished if it is separated from the 'smart roads' initiatives.<EOL>
The Commission remains deeply concerned about the current political and human rights situation and the respect for fundamental freedoms which at this stage would hardly allow for free and fair elections.<EOL>
As long as we have national parties, we will never have a Europe.<EOL>
   – Mr President, the EU’s energy policy has two dimensions: the external or geopolitical dimension, and a domestic dimension, because energy security also means the rational use of energy.<EOL>
Further, 1 May is fast approaching.<EOL>
I saw how it was built and I said that the miracle of the 20th century is Europe.<EOL>
With what intermediaries is the Commission allowed to work?<EOL>
Then I would like to answer one separate question, which is linked to the subject of enlargement.<EOL>
In memory of the almost one million victims, and to express our hope that we never again see a tragedy of this nature, I would ask you to observe a minute’s silence.<EOL>
They include the rights of women, as has been said here, and the rights of children, but they also include the rights of the disabled, the sick, the elderly, everyone.<EOL>
The concept of inspection has been rightly mentioned.<EOL>
It is the world's fourth largest cotton producer, and yet, according to its leaders, 15 % of the population live in abject poverty and wages are almost as low as they are in the third world.<EOL>
If so, with the President's permission, I should like to ask a question on that subject.<EOL>
Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you once more that, since the start of this parliamentary term, the Radical Members have not been taking part either in the votes in the House or in the committees: this is to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Members to the fact that some of the Members are denied the chance to contribute to parliamentary life on the same grounds and by the same means as the other Members.<EOL>
Our group sees immense problems with the margins in Section 4 of the budget.<EOL>
Representatives of the European Union set out the concerns that still exist on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of prisoners, termed ‘hostile militants’.<EOL>
President-designate of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all let us address some issues of policy substance.<EOL>
We cannot have a European Union that ignores that.<EOL>
The European Union must take action to reduce this influence.<EOL>
The fact remains that the European Parliament is the institution most trusted by EU citizens.<EOL>
If all this is true, and this is what the Commission report tells us, then what we need to do is obvious, but it is also extremely difficult.<EOL>
When there are more than 20 million people unemployed in Europe and immigration is swamping our nation states, I think the European Parliament has better things to do than flout parliamentary democracy, even if it is European.<EOL>
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.<EOL>
There was a strong message from the Social Affairs Council as to the necessity of strengthening social dialogue.<EOL>
The European Union is fighting discrimination on all fronts, in Europe as well as beyond.<EOL>
All of it should be poverty-focused.<EOL>
It is unfortunately notable that, despite the efforts made since the oil tankers Prestige and Erika sank, the situation has hardly improved.<EOL>
<EOL>
What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US.<EOL>
Allow me, however, to welcome the fact that a kind of evaluation from the year gone by is included and that there is more strategic thinking when it comes to the Commission' s intended way of working.<EOL>
All I can do is refer Members to the conclusions of the meeting that my colleague, Mrs Loyola De Palacio, held with the representatives of the airline companies' association.<EOL>
The threat of terrorism is a threat to our security, our democracies and our way of life in the European Union.<EOL>
We need to see if the money we provide is having an effect, at least in accordance with our wishes and calculations.<EOL>
Firstly, the immediate recognition of Republic of Cyprus which is, as you all know, a Member State of the European Union and on which the European Council recently took the right stand.<EOL>
In paragraphs 18 and 24 of her report, Mrs Saïfi rightly emphasises the need to combat all forms of modern slavery and forced labour, as well as the exploitation of children.<EOL>
Also on the subject of cuts, I would like to state that in our vote on Thursday we will insist on the reinstatement of some items which have been sacrificed, and also on the reinforcement of certain objectives.<EOL>
As a result, it will in reality be the Swedish pension funds and other bank shareholders themselves that will lose out.<EOL>
We need to have participants from the Third World since there is an international dimension to corporate social responsibility.<EOL>
I am pleased for my fellow citizens who will be travelling back to Poland for Christmas.<EOL>
For this reason, as well as justifiable concern about the operational effectiveness of the future Union, it seems absolutely indispensable to have a transitional period for serious discussions within the scope of the negotiations.<EOL>
On the basis of experience of existing instruments, the Commission estimates that well over 70% of this competitiveness and innovation programme budget will be targeted to SMEs.<EOL>
It seems clear to me that inherent in this policy is a profound contempt for what we are discussing here and for the rules that the European Union gives us.<EOL>
I think that now the time has come when we can consistently and properly put members in such a position as regards how they deal with OLAF and act in relation to it, that they are not lumped together with the administration.<EOL>
I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council.<EOL>
The Commission’s position on the amendments contained in the various recommendations is as follows: so far as the proposal in the field of education and training is concerned, the Commission is able to agree to the three amendments voted by the Committee on Culture at second reading because they bring major improvements to the way the programme is implemented.<EOL>
This will make it easier to shoulder a problem in which we would otherwise have been held to ransom by old-school politics and would have needed to raise the spectre of Mr Berlusconi to feel absolved from our mistakes.<EOL>
Commissioner, we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture, because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us.<EOL>
   The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0461/2003) by Mr Manders, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (10933/5/2003 - C5-0445/2003 - 2002/0021 (COD)).<EOL>
Customs officials stopped 32 million counterfeit medicinal products from entering the EU in 2008.<EOL>
I am not a Europhobe.<EOL>
It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty.<EOL>
The President of the Commission spoke of a new Marshall Plan.<EOL>
Member of the Commission.<EOL>
I would appreciate it, if the Council and the Commission could assure that the implementation of Article 20 of the Treaty is closely monitored and that every deviation is investigated thoroughly.<EOL>
in writing. - Having worked on this area at Committee level before, I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels.<EOL>
It would be not just absurd but in fact inconsistent with the very principle of subsidiarity to also deprive them de facto of the instrument of national aid.<EOL>
What is done always reflects the idea that social security benefits have some sort of adverse effect on a national economy, yet they do no such thing; they do it some good!<EOL>
Firstly, the countries of Europe are not immigrant countries, yet they are currently facing enormous problems with foreign nationals and are simply not in a position to take any more immigrants.<EOL>
Although it is in a minority in numerical terms, the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player.<EOL>
The time for removing the restrictions is now.<EOL>
The weakening of the proposal by the Council unfortunately is also in evidence in the context of environmental accountability, which is covered in Article 3.<EOL>
What measures does it intend to take on the 'activity' of credit rating agencies?<EOL>
When you were designated President, we thought, based on your statements, that the final decision for appointing each of the Commissioners would have your seal of approval.<EOL>
It also implies taking advantage of the geographical position of the ORs, particularly in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, encouraging closer cooperation with neighbouring third countries and developing our islands - precisely because they are islands - as centres of excellence for scientific research, notably in maritime studies, climatology and environmental studies.<EOL>
More importantly, their work has also meant that the role of the Member States of origin that have to pay and of those in which treatment is received can be clearly regulated.<EOL>
Complainants must also be able to appeal against negative decisions.<EOL>
The EPLP recognises that attention needs to be given to the social consequences of restructuring and has voted for this resolution as it is non-legislative.<EOL>
That should then give you some kind of yardstick for judging the views of this House on the very sensitive question of the liberal professions.<EOL>
Currently, however, a 1.3% growth of GDP and a 0.2% growth in employment are predicted for 2002. Unemployment is, therefore, set to increase across the Community.<EOL>
<EOL>
With a European perspective on research infrastructure, researchers will increasingly be able to obtain mutual benefit across Europe's borders from new investment.<EOL>
Adequate exceptions must therefore be included in the directive, hence the proposal that, for airports situated in these regions, the rules laid down in the directive will not apply where they will not guarantee compliance with the universal public service obligations.<EOL>
Finally concerning the legal framework, we will set up an inventory of national measures which have to be taken in accordance with the relevant Community law.<EOL>
Finally, Mr President and Commissioner, we will vote in favour of Amendment No 11, submitted by the Liberal Group, which we consider necessary, not only in strict application of the provisions of the single market, which are not really in keeping with the two possibilities in the current text, but also because we think that it provides a fairer compromise between the legitimate interests of companies and the legitimate interests of personal data protection for natural persons and users.<EOL>
If the compromise is approved, this means in practice that Parliament says it is acceptable to appropriate assets.<EOL>
That is why we have pressed for the authorisation of encryption systems - not least with the Americans - and for only allowing them to be deciphered when there are legal grounds for doing so.<EOL>
Another important aspect is collaboration with the European Union's structures: with the European Ombudsman in particular for limited petitions but also with the European Commission whose collaboration so far has been good but which can be improved in terms of both the time it takes the Commission to reply and the quality of its answers.<EOL>
Mr President, I personally considered the decision taken at Gothenburg to incorporate the environmental dimension in the Lisbon process to be crucial.<EOL>
I believe, in fact, that the fund is a valuable tool for enabling the European Union to show solidarity with the populations of regions affected by natural disasters, by providing financial support to help ensure a swift return to normal living conditions.<EOL>
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.<EOL>
(SV) Mr President, we talk a lot in this House about how much we pay in aid at present and about how much we should pay in the future.<EOL>
That is why I would like to announce two pieces of good news in this morning's debate.<EOL>
Greek livestock farmers are in despair; they are taking action to demand substantial aid to help them survive.<EOL>
It is not defined only by what the Commission does.<EOL>
(PL) Mr President, as is the case every year, the Committee on Legal Affairs is presenting Parliament with its report regarding the European Commission's report on the application of EU law and, as is the case every year, members of the Committee on Legal Affairs have many reservations as to the substance and the form in which the Commission prepared the report.<EOL>
We would also like to increase opportunities for Members of the European Parliament to visit prisons.<EOL>
We therefore call on the Kenyan authorities to reconsider their stance on the matter and give their mass media the legislative freedom they need in order to try, at least, to function as democratically as possible.<EOL>
None of this can be found in the current proposal, which is why I have chosen to vote against the report.<EOL>
Human beings are God's creation and we should not set ourselves up as arbiters in questions of life and death.<EOL>
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank Mr Liikanen once again for being here with us today and answering our questions.<EOL>
I welcome the timing, format and approach chosen by Parliament this year.<EOL>
Life expectancy is 36 years.<EOL>
The European Union has 26 fisheries agreements with third countries, 15 with countries in Africa and the Indian Ocean and 10 in the North Atlantic countries with 1 in Latin America.<EOL>
The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species.<EOL>
First of all, what we are doing now in the task force and indeed in the Commission - a communication on 12 May already mentioned this - is examining the possibility of reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, including by broadening the arsenal of incentives for compliance, as I prefer to call it.<EOL>
Finally, an important aspect of this process will be to create informed and empowered patients - informed as to treatment, medicine, the possibilities of cross-border healthcare and how to choose a physician.<EOL>
If this initiative begins to have a real effect in the near future, bringing about a qualitative and effective improvement in the quality of the living conditions of the people concerned, then, yes, it will be a world first.<EOL>
Two African immigrants were drowned and another 14 lost without trace in a tragic patera sinking off the coast of Fuerteventura (Spain) on 28 November 2004.<EOL>
We would call on the Commission to advance beyond mere monitoring and finally take some action.<EOL>
The next item is the agenda. The following amendments have been proposed:<EOL>
We are seeing the impact of the Palestinian problem spreading throughout the Middle East and becoming mixed up with the interests of the different players.<EOL>
There is a lot of money going to agriculture and cohesion funds; have these sums been delivering on the targets that we aimed for?<EOL>
Projects by, for and about men will be supported in the Member States.<EOL>
However, it is hoped that the necessary legislation will be able to be adopted within a short time.<EOL>
Therefore Parliament has decided: (1) to maintain a common line, i.e. to keep the package of external financial assistance instruments together (including also - so far informally - the IfS); (2) to restore with the EP's second reading amendments the positions adopted by the EP at first reading, i.e. to adopt regarding all external financial assistance instruments the same amendments that were rejected by the Council; and (3) to go for a quick second reading.<EOL>
This should first and foremost address noise charges, the expenses involved and the relationship between the two.<EOL>
I welcome the efforts made by the current governing coalition to re-establish political stability in Ukraine, which is an essential condition for the consolidation of democracy in the country.<EOL>
In an economic democracy, which is achieved through worker participation, why not provide for an obligation to have a representation, with a monitoring function too, of workers/shareholders on company boards of listed companies?<EOL>
Although I am in favour of protecting plants, I think that first and foremost we have to protect people's health.<EOL>
We cannot accept this being converted from a policy of support for production to a policy of social handouts.<EOL>
This is the spirit that we have to discover.<EOL>
Therefore, much of the debate has already taken place. And I think that, at this moment, both the Council and the Commission know the opinion of the members of this Parliament in this respect.<EOL>
EU-Cameroon forest law agreement - EU-Republic of Congo forest law agreement - FLEGT voluntary partnership agreements (debate)<EOL>
India is the second most populous country on this globe, with a proud and tested democratic tradition.<EOL>
The European Union, of course, is not responsible for education, but it can disseminate good practice.<EOL>
I look forward to continuing to work together with you on these proposals in the coming months in the interest of European energy consumers.<EOL>
To conclude, I believe that the Commission should pay a great deal of attention to the Aldo report, so that this document might result in specific proposals.<EOL>
But the one area that I want to focus on just now is the area of residents.<EOL>
These arrangements must naturally be fulfilled without prejudice to the debate and without prejudice to the examination of alternative arrangements that may prove appropriate.<EOL>
However, this is not the case when it comes to environmental taxes.<EOL>
This is why the review of the trans-European networks with a view to the financial perspectives must be more ambitious.<EOL>
and<EOL>
I also consider it important that we place great emphasis on legal culture not being lost in practice.<EOL>
This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.<EOL>
The Treaty is the European Union's law.<EOL>
We have said that even if weighting is needed, there should be no rotation system.<EOL>
On the occasion of a peaceful action for equal rights for gay people, we wanted to hand over a letter to the Mayor of Moscow signed by nearly 50 Members of this House.<EOL>
While research - into both fusion and fission - is a good thing (albeit diversified), I deeply regret the increase in appropriations (EUR 700 000 for 2012) as well as the anticipated financial tinkering, which would lead to part of the European research budget being emptied simply to finance ITER.<EOL>
I heard that the website is updated only once every six months.<EOL>
Efficiency in administration is also important and in this respect, I have to underline that the Commission, despite the adjustment to the Lisbon Treaty, will not request any new posts this year.<EOL>
However, the concerns that have been raised by some Members are already addressed in the text of the Commission communication, in which it is explicitly stated that the Commission is willing to allocate resources from the European Social Fund to specific initiatives to retrain and provide vocational refresher training for workers, precisely so that they too can be instrumental in achieving this innovation, which should make European industry more competitive.<EOL>
I should like to see them sitting at all tables where peace and reconstruction are discussed.<EOL>
At present, it seems that there was a transfer of financial information between private companies from the EU to the United States.<EOL>
On this her birthday another 24,000 will die.<EOL>
Mr President, I want to start by congratulating Professor Cabrol on his report.<EOL>
Mr Vinci, there were also charges against the police and not just the police excesses that I have condemned, let us make it clear.<EOL>
The next item is the joint debate on<EOL>
One of the possible solutions to deal with the so-called carousel fraud in this sector would be to apply the reverse charge mechanism.<EOL>
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my sincere congratulations and thanks to Doris Pack for her sterling effort.<EOL>
Today this concept refers to North Africa, and the EU’s priorities lie with the Maghreb and Mashreq, rather than Belarus or Ukraine.<EOL>
It was the dogmatic removal of customs protection that destroyed industrial balances beneath a wave of imports.<EOL>
The setting-up of high level groups is an excellent idea in theory, but unfortunately CARS 21 was dominated by a conservative branch of industry.<EOL>
Rather than this being an attempt to achieve consistent safety requirements, this is an attempt to increase competition.<EOL>
Only technical innovations embodied in a computer program and meeting the patentability criteria of novelty, inventiveness and industrial applicability can be patented.<EOL>
A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof.<EOL>
For our own sakes, we must become clear in our own minds about what it is that unites us.<EOL>
In many regions there are already successful programmes under which labels of origin are prescribed for meat products.<EOL>
No matter how much assistance is granted to workers, it will be worthless if companies keep closing down one after the other and if we cannot reverse the investment drain in Europe.<EOL>
We must realize that the consequences of climate change on the water regime may cause a domino effect and may impact on many sectors of the economy.<EOL>
An element of that organization is the proposed spread of tele-employment, which will have strikingly detrimental effects on the social, unionistic and employment rights of working people.<EOL>
However, we have not been able to put an end to the cruel civil war.<EOL>
It may become necessary to change marketing conditions that adversely affect producers' incomes, and the Commission must respond appropriately to such a situation by taking the necessary measures.<EOL>
The Energy Charter is a key instrument in this context.<EOL>
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.<EOL>
I think the Council will also have to change its working methods.<EOL>
Babies' health is too important to be left in the hands of a multinational company's marketing department.<EOL>
In its plan, the Commission refers to the need for increased economic growth and more entrepreneurship in order to keep the European social model going at a satisfactory level.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, this report is about the phasing out as quickly as possible of old oil tankers, which have been responsible, for example, for the Prestige disaster.<EOL>
It was the two oldest nation states of Europe in diplomatic terms, France and the United Kingdom, which took action in accordance with their national traditions and interests - traditions and interests which are admittedly different, but which together are powerful enough not to need to fit in with the Community's low profile, as Christophe Réveillard rightly pointed out.<EOL>
We therefore think that this project must be approved. It is of overriding importance for Europe and Portugal alike.<EOL>
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group.<EOL>
European and economic policy cannot be limited to prudent monetary policy and the monitoring of Budget deficits.<EOL>
These measures are nothing less than an attempt to establish a Soviet-style command economy, and we all know how well that worked.<EOL>
That is a rather limited view of things.<EOL>
However, there must be clear rules, otherwise the money will not get spent.<EOL>
Do not misunderstand me.<EOL>
We need to react against Morocco, curtailing all initiatives on commercial agreements, beginning with the renewal of the fishing agreements.<EOL>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, it is not easy to hold an objective debate when you are talking about 100 000 children being made homeless, millions of farmers on the streets and people living in absolutely truly bitter poverty.<EOL>
   . The issue here is the conclusion of another fishing agreement between the EU and various Indian Ocean countries, in this case Mauritius.<EOL>
Its aim is to ensure that, within six years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has 'properly implemented and enforced' the Community acquis on free competition in the internal market and also 'other trade-related areas'.<EOL>
That is where there are deficits.<EOL>
Mr President, like most of my colleagues here, I too welcome the fact that this agreement has come about.<EOL>
That demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change.<EOL>
I have put forward an amendment on this.<EOL>
In this Community, we certainly do emphasise the importance of economic matters.<EOL>
The time has come for Europe to be a power capable of genuine political expression, of sustaining a social project and framing a common foreign and defence policy.<EOL>
The globalisation of the economy and the relocation of European companies have led to concerns regarding the external dimension of social policy.<EOL>
I would like to thank Mr Henderson.<EOL>
There is only one reason for the great fuss which surrounded the appointment of the President of the Commission and which has surrounded this case, and that is that these questions still have to be decided unanimously.<EOL>
This cooperation between Parliament and the JPA began in 2007, and last year resulted in the creation of a fully-fledged delegation for relations with the JPA.<EOL>
The degree of self-regulation in broadcasting differs from one Member State to another, but we all agree that we must work towards some commonality in this area and that self-regulation must be underpinned by some legal basis.<EOL>
Would the President-in-Office not agree that the international community, including the European Union, should do more, because this has gone on for far too long?<EOL>
(HU) Every time we begin talking about advanced therapy medicinal products, stem cell or embryonic cell therapies, or embryo research or organ transplantation, vehement debate inevitably ensues.<EOL>
As I said, in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations.<EOL>
The situation in Azerbaijan at the time was particularly serious, with allegations that the government was holding political prisoners and indeed that torture and ill-treatment in custody was common.<EOL>
This proposal for a regulation is blazing a legislative trail on a subject that is fundamental for European Union citizens and enterprises, namely the transparency and dissemination of information on food products.<EOL>
   Mr President, you will remember that I challenged the referral of this affair to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.<EOL>
Children are brought to life not only within traditional families, but also within other models of life.<EOL>
First, the by-catch problem being a worldwide problem and the question of the Commission taking leadership.<EOL>
Well, perhaps one can understand the Commission – the issue of quotas is really awkward.<EOL>
This has taught us to find creative solutions to non-standard situations, which is going to come in useful.<EOL>
Unlike at present, the draft budget would mean future expenditure having to be taken out of the EU budget.<EOL>
We have to remember that this piece of legislation is Member State driven, and the fact that the Member States have met and managed to agree a comprehensive list of projects has to be recognised positively, whilst not denying Parliament its rights under the codecision procedure.<EOL>
<EOL>
The status of the European Data Protection Supervisor and his deputy, who together form a sort of mini-committee, must, above all, ensure their independence in the Community institutional context beyond the mere budgetary aspects.<EOL>
These politicians fly their national flags on their parliaments and presidential palaces, but sadly the only flag their people see is the flag of death.<EOL>
The danger is that there will be pressure for the EU to become the organisation of first resort when next there is a crisis to be dealt with and that NATO would increasingly be relegated to a purely residual role as a collective defence organisation.<EOL>
I cannot remember the address now, but it is a well-known public fact that that Office has been in existence for a year.<EOL>
And the European Union must offer an example and lead this effective prosecution of offences against the marine environment at world level.<EOL>
Another one is these countries' lack of the defence mechanism offered by the euro area, which meant that they were in a much more defenceless position when the crisis hit them.<EOL>
I agree with Mr Dimas: the future, global climate change, and the responses to these challenges constitute one of the most important questions.<EOL>
We are in any event persuaded that the Commission intends moving in the right direction by filling what we consider to be a number of gaps in the Green Paper.<EOL>
So it is unacceptable that projects that harm the environment should at present be supported with massive amounts of money, considering how aid is channelled for projects that improve the environment.<EOL>
The practical findings of recent decades are being used to revitalise the internal market and form the basis for the incorporation of important corrective measures.<EOL>
You cannot link derivatives and pension funds, just like that.<EOL>
The motion under discussion is the second in succession which intends to authorise the marketing of poultrymeat for human consumption where it has received anti-microbe treatment.<EOL>
Our committee believes that the right to education is one of the most important fundamental human rights, and no one should be prevented from exercising this right by financial status, poverty or discrimination; also, we must continue to demand equal treatment.<EOL>
In closing, I also welcome today's statements by Commissioner Hübner and the Commission's determination to progress with the cohesion policy.<EOL>
I admit that we are going to get an extra part-session this particular month, but only to average out for the one in 12 sessions that we need to do.<EOL>
I voted against the entire report - which was nonetheless adopted on the basis of 359 votes in favour, 79 against and 50 abstentions - because it would entail a relaxation of the Stability and Growth Pact and undermine the Swedish constitution.<EOL>
As Mr Bernard-Reymond is aware, my initial concern at his first draft report was that we were spending most of our time lecturing China.<EOL>
Such measures do not represent a disproportionate burden.<EOL>
In July this year we adopted a comprehensive framework for its activities which will shortly be followed by detailed rules of application.<EOL>
In relation to this grave episode - and the previous speakers highlighted this - secrecy and doubts have surrounded military bodies, institutions, governments and nations for two decades.<EOL>
The third principle is to ensure that we can organise an entire continent around a single system that must aim to be politically and economically coherent.<EOL>
Like the rapporteur, I welcome the close cooperation between Member States in this area.<EOL>
I would also like to remind you of something I mentioned earlier, that any vacuum that may be left in Community legislation will be filled in by the Member States and therefore will defeat the purpose of having this harmonised legislation and will mean a return to a fragmented set of rules and regulations that harm the industry, consumer confidence, cause problems for the internal market and of course do not achieve the level of protection that we would all like to have.<EOL>
The report calls for the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports to be made legally binding, but we cannot forget that this war has cost $6 000 billion, which could otherwise have been invested in attaining the Millennium Goals.<EOL>
Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice.<EOL>
Nonetheless, Mr President, the fact remains that terrorism today is a real source of conflict from all points of view and can lead to caution within societies and cause them to shut themselves off.<EOL>
These measures are part of the government's efforts to crack down on the strikes the MDC has called for this week.<EOL>
It should also make it necessary to bring in an appeal mechanism to suspend transfer of asylum seekers who are subject to a transfer decision resulting from the application of the Dublin regulation.<EOL>
Mr President, over the past 26 years we, like Parliament, have asked for their release 15 times.<EOL>
Alongside the diverse measures which the Union is taking, I would like to propose two specific measures, because it seems to me they are missing.<EOL>
Mr President, I would like to make a brief comment concerning Sweden.<EOL>
The Commission has already confirmed that it is dealing with Croatia and Turkey even-handedly.<EOL>
It is impossible to reach our policy goals, that is, growth of the economy and enhancement of competitiveness, without increased allocations for research, innovation and SMEs, which account for about 90 of all enterprises of the European Union.<EOL>
If we want competition and liberalisation, then the industry must not be structured vertically, with everything, from extraction to the last distributor, being in the same pair of hands.<EOL>
And lastly, the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support specific Programme of CIP launched calls for proposals for 2007 and 2008 with a focus on pilot project testing ICT-based innovations, where SMEs receive more than 30% of the total budget.<EOL>
Now for some more specific issues.<EOL>
The principle that consumers should know what they eat should apply not only to prepacked foods but also to food that they buy over the counter or when they eat out.<EOL>
The aim of those who designed this product is quite clear: they wish to conceal the health warnings with colour sheaths and, eventually, with commercial advertisements.<EOL>
We expect you to use this political authority in forming the new Commission and in your political leadership of the new Commission over the next five years.<EOL>
I would like to make some final remarks as regards the conduct of my presidency.<EOL>
That would surely ultimately lead to the culling of vaccinated animals.<EOL>
Although this seems to appear to be our approach to the situation, it is far more common foresight.<EOL>
As regards the Basel Agreement, only a few issues remain to be finalised by the middle of this year.<EOL>
In relation to development policy, we have repeatedly pointed out that it makes no sense at all to maintain two complete systems running in parallel - one for the European Development Fund and one for development aid.<EOL>
Clearly this is a risk, and one more good reason to start a national dialogue in Bahrain as soon as possible to avoid that option.<EOL>
- this directive must provide dissuasive sanctions to be applied by the Member States in the event of infringement of national legislation.<EOL>
I have already started considering possible measures which will ensure that our high-level food and feed safety system will become even more efficient.<EOL>
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.<EOL>
Statements by the President<EOL>
All sectors must contribute to this system.<EOL>
I welcomed the comments made by Mr Poettering, Mr Cox and Mr Voggenhuber, who, for the first time in a long while, focused on the issue of the Commission in their speeches.<EOL>
Accordingly, I can only urge the Commission to learn the lessons from this directive and encourage the House to keep pursuing the path of harmonisation in respect of the draft instruments currently under discussion, and particularly the proposal for a directive on services as well as the proposal on measures to promote sales, on which a stalemate has been reached in the Council.<EOL>
Partly it is because we do not talk enough about the benefits of shifting to a post-carbon world - the millions of jobs in green energy, the better-insulated homes, the improved public transport.<EOL>
What we have seen is a major propaganda campaign that does not respect pluralism and the different opinions held by the Members of this House, nor does it take into account the spectrum of opinions held by the public.<EOL>
We are able to offer you that.<EOL>
There are many people in favour of the use of pesticides and many who are opposed.<EOL>
One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying ‘you are either for a federal Europe or against it’.<EOL>
As we have a particular interest it may be that, by maintaining that contact, we can support the process in a very constructive way.<EOL>
Consequently, I think that everything has moved towards making the United Nations proposals on bio-diversity, which date from 1992, compatible with one another; in this respect, the upholding of the security and dignity of the human race is compatible with the industrial use and continuing research into this subject.<EOL>
I abstained on the amended proposal, because I feel that on this issue no compromises are necessary.<EOL>
This has nothing to do with the culture of the European Union.<EOL>
Yet we do not have much time.<EOL>
We would refer to the motion for a resolution presented by our group with regard to the concrete aspects we are debating here.<EOL>
Meanwhile, the gulf between the West Bank and Gaza grows ever wider, with the threat of a permanent division.<EOL>
Mr President, when we leave this place this evening, most of us will take a black car.<EOL>
The fact is that mini-reforms would ruin farmers' prospects of a prosperous future.<EOL>
At the moment, the European Union is both institutionally fragmented and legally hindered as far as development aid is concerned.<EOL>
The national systems are producing too much resistance.<EOL>
Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever.<EOL>
At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan, an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union.<EOL>
Hamas is, however, a movement that has not yet renounced violence, while the Palestinian people need help from Europe – including financial aid – more than ever.<EOL>
The Treaty of Lisbon also introduces far-reaching procedural changes, and in particular it lifts the requirement for first and second readings.<EOL>
I am still optimistic and must say that, in the light of the debate held in Naples and today’s meeting, I believe that we can look to 12 and 13 December with confidence based on the fact that there are signs that some sort of positive solution can be achieved.<EOL>
Mr President, since I was the one to negotiate the compromise on behalf of our group, I need to make one or two things clear at this point. It is correct - and we have since verified this - that Mrs Green, the other MEPs and myself were not present for a while, but rather our colleagues discussed among themselves what might be possible, and that is the way things were actually discussed.<EOL>
We have not yet analysed all the replies, so I do not know its overall reaction.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
Unfortunately, national governments are either unwilling or unable to achieve the implementation measures, as mentioned in the Delors White Paper.<EOL>
The most important task policy-makers and politicians have is to strike a healthy balance between sustainability and agricultural economics.<EOL>
Unlike causes such as disease, anti-social behaviour, race or gender, this represents a condition for which civilised countries should organise ordinary preventive measures.<EOL>
On the question of aid funding, I believe that the budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country.<EOL>
The document voted on today is aimed at adapting the financial measures for implementing fisheries policy to the evolution of the legislative framework, to changes in current needs, and to legal clarification on actions to be undertaken, particularly those included in Decision 2000/439/EC that have not yet been taken up by the text of Regulation No 861/2006.<EOL>
Access to such professions is regulated by States in accordance with local tradition and culture and is also subject to responsibilities and assurances offering minimum guarantees for consumers.<EOL>
We ignore it at our peril.<EOL>
It is very much a people's issue - parents and others throughout the whole European Union are terrified that their children might come into contact with drugs and end up as drug abusers.<EOL>
We do, however, have a good opportunity to improve the draft by means of amendments.<EOL>
It requests the reform of the United Nations Conventions on drugs and other narcotics, as they are considered to be too severe and repressive, in particular for cannabis users.<EOL>
The proposal that we have on the table today - which is referred to as BONUS for short - aims to change this.<EOL>
New technologies have now transformed our lives, and leisure activities are by no means excluded from this process.<EOL>
Mr President, as budget year 2002 is very important - one might even say incredibly important - because of enlargement, which is now entering a crucial phase, and because we have significant problems with the common agricultural policy and have not yet made full use of the Structural Funds, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism wishes to propose three key points. We believe that structural measures under the four Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Equal and Urban are very important, as are innovative measures.<EOL>
In its entirety, therefore, the resolution is fair and I fully support it.<EOL>
Up to now, we have insisted only on the applicants fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, while the question as to whether the EU itself could achieve the goals of cohesion and integration was treated as unimportant.<EOL>
Will he now join me in voting to go with the euro?<EOL>
It is important that we raise the maximum guaranteed quantity to higher levels than today's so that it can be adjusted to total Community consumption where there is a gap that can be filled, to average annual exports and to the establishing of a measure of security.<EOL>
Are you?<EOL>
Political opposition groups are not given any opportunity to function democratically, and this often leads them to seek support from related tribes over the borders, which in turn gives the dictators an excuse to take cross-border military action.<EOL>
That is also very important.<EOL>
As to conducting a campaign, I am not sure that the Commission's resources extend as far as those of the honourable gentleman who has been referred to, but in general terms I certainly think it is important that we should put the facts out as clearly as possible, and this is one of the facts that will now be available to the Commission through its offices in London and other parts of the United Kingdom to make the true facts known.<EOL>
As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pointed out, we should call for more research into improving animal diets and better management of livestock effluents in intensive farming regions.<EOL>
But on the other hand, virtually no financial provision has been made for emergency aid.<EOL>
Why did you wait until after the German election?<EOL>
, in writing. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years the European Union has been one of the international actors that has shown the way in the development of a sustainable global climate policy.<EOL>
The European Union is beginning to work on, but intends to consolidate, a clear position, a clear strategy for the Union so that we can maintain an active role and a commitment to the protection of and respect for human rights.<EOL>
Compared to the total stasis of the other big players, not one of whom budged an inch?<EOL>
We clearly need to do more.<EOL>
3.<EOL>
The European Space Agency has operated on a transnational basis on our continent for several years now and has played a pivotal role in developing the space activities of European countries.<EOL>
As pointed out by my colleague, it did this most recently on the proposal for a directive on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.<EOL>
However, all these initiatives must be predicated on the principle of protection of civil rights and fundamental freedoms.<EOL>
The Prüm Treaty, which is intended to combat serious crime, is an example of this positive enhanced cooperation for Europe.<EOL>
It is in an effort to rebuild and restore that consensus, support and solidarity amongst our Member States that we are undertaking this review.<EOL>
But sitting up until all hours of the morning on three occasions haggling over ECU 40 million spread over four years is really going a little too far.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your statement and more specifically, for your promise that you will listen to the voice of Parliament.<EOL>
This is half-hearted and inconsistent.<EOL>
One of the greatest threats with the information society is the growth of inequality.<EOL>
Instead of wasting her time preventing the decline of the nuclear industry, Mrs de Palacio would do better finally to present the directives required if Europe is to catch up in this area.<EOL>
These losses - especially in the light of the 2 million stockpiled vehicles - are based on significant falls in the book value of leasing vehicles which then lead to problems in this respect, too.<EOL>
The Commission has just produced a communication making it clear that the cost of not having functional airspace blocks for building a Single European Sky is about EUR 1 billion.<EOL>
The budget procedure has already shown that the agreement works.<EOL>
It is clear that, in many Member States, homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States.<EOL>
When we criticise only the rulers of Belarus, we are departing from reality.<EOL>
I agree with Mr Solana's critique of this kind of conference diplomacy.<EOL>
It must, however, be remembered that they emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, which are a serious threat to public health.<EOL>
If political will is combined with political creativity at Union level and at national and regional political levels and channelled into new energy sources, doubling looks set to be achieved before 2010 - I am sure of that.<EOL>
We can perfectly well take on that job if the Commission keeps us continuously informed and briefed, and I think this will be something very important.<EOL>
With regard to the question of whether I know if other delegations have already brought up the problem that you mention in your supplementary question within the General Affairs Council, I must admit that I do not attend all of the General Affairs Councils.<EOL>
What has really turned me against this report – in its final wording – is that it promotes standards that far exceed the ‘minimum’, for example, the register of translators, ‘compensation’ in the event of insolvency or the presence of a psychiatrist.<EOL>
The next item is the joint debate on:<EOL>
Alongside what we have learned from the European Year of Education through Sport and from the Lifelong Learning, Youth and Europe for Citizens programmes, it is now time to devise initiatives to make the most, in our times, of the various forms of physical activity comprising sport, both in schools, clubs and associations, and as spontaneous, informal physical activity.<EOL>
It is an obsession of the ECB because it is the mandate of the ECB.<EOL>
The current price on our internal market is something like three times higher than that on the international market and, whatever happens, we will, in the current WTO round, be obliged to reduce our external protection for sugar.<EOL>
Consequently, in the absence of a common tourism policy, issues in this industry, which covers several areas and involves a wide range of services and professions, must be taken into account at European level.<EOL>
As I have already had occasion to say to you, the measures that have been taken have in fact been either within a national context or within a framework of traditional multilateral diplomacy.<EOL>
The promised referendum for the residents about whether or not to join Indonesia never materialised.<EOL>
The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier.<EOL>
If Central Asia is to develop its economic independence it will require foreign assistance in developing alternative gas and oil pipeline routes and new markets.<EOL>
I am sure that some of the fears expressed here in this debate will not come true at all.<EOL>
We must open up this Parliament!<EOL>
The Commission is using all its channels to express concerns regarding forced labour and non-respect for fundamental freedoms.<EOL>
I think this will be rather a long answer because it cannot be answered in just a few sentences.<EOL>
- I wish to state the reasons why I felt obliged to abstain on the final vote, even though, in common with other Members, I am totally in favour of the protection of fundamental freedoms and rights, and with ensuring that future social developments can be taken account of.<EOL>
Council states yet again that it wants to ensure that the TFTP will continue.<EOL>
- the precautionary nature of the plans, given the lack of scientific knowledge regarding eel stock numbers and the spatial distribution of successive generations of eel;<EOL>
There is unfortunately still a large gap between words and deeds.<EOL>
But one other thing is certain, namely that it is desirable and essential that the ability of Russia, of all countries, to repay its loans should be re-established as quickly as possible if confidence is to be restored.<EOL>
A ban on foreign investments should be introduced.<EOL>
We are tired of hearing young Europeans say, 'They would have hired me if I had experience, but no one will give me the chance to gain any.'<EOL>
At the very latest when we hear how rigorously and scrupulously attempts are apparently being made to build up a gene monopoly for genetically modified seed, the alarm bells should ring when there is talk of cloned meat.<EOL>
Finally, there is the Economic and Social Committee, the only area where we do have a problem.<EOL>
It is lax monetary policy, more than anything else, that has eroded the US economy.<EOL>
Israel also controls the border crossing with Egypt.<EOL>
The Commission often finds that its prosecutions before the Court of Justice on environmental matters are initiated by private citizens.<EOL>
They all worked on this text and contributed to the result, which is that, in all probability in a few minutes’ time, we will be able to give almost unanimous assent to this text, and I believe – and we will also rightly be saying this in the next few weeks to the population of Europe – that the work has been worthwhile in the interests of safety for the users of Europe’s roads.<EOL>
This debate provides a satisfactory end to a process that has lasted an exceptionally long time, having had to overcome serious difficulties.<EOL>
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her report, which gives a sound and clear overview of the present situation in higher education, the existing programmes and the possible forms of cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education.<EOL>
This does not depend in any circumstances on national institutions and authorities.<EOL>
President of the Commission, I am speaking on behalf of the European radical Members of the Bonino List.<EOL>
The proposal tries to give the impression that cigarillos with filters are cigarettes with dark-coloured wrappers and that they should be taxed accordingly, like cigarettes.<EOL>
The review will comprise an overview of the international events that have taken place, an overview of the assistance provided and received and an overview of the main difficulties observed by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties could be resolved.<EOL>
It makes sense to improve the treatment of children by increasing the research, development and approval of medicines which are suited to the metabolism of the child.<EOL>
So we are astonished at the severity of the European Parliament' s report and the general tone of yesterday' s debate.<EOL>
I wish you success in your work!<EOL>
Even if we do not find the results of the strategy satisfying, the objectives set in the strategy are still relevant.<EOL>
Report (A5-0106/1999) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol setting out for the period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2002 the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé e Principe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé e Principe (COM(1999)0550 - C5-0305/1999 - 1999/0228(CNS))<EOL>
It is clearly defined and we have no problem technically or politically on that score.<EOL>
Mr President, thank you very much.<EOL>
Therefore, it must also have access to the documents.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
The compromise amendments we are presenting to plenary, together with the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group (Amendments Nos 19 to 32) are the result of this concern that we all share.<EOL>
The report points out that the rapid developments in information technology could easily lead to new inequalities in society as a result of differential access to the new information and communication technologies.<EOL>
The new Treaty brings advantages in a number of different areas.<EOL>
We also need to work intensively to reduce our differences on Georgia and Kosovo, on which an exchange of views was held.<EOL>
However, I think that better communication and cooperation are required between the countries which have emerged from the crisis using proactive, incentive measures, rather than by raising taxes, and those facing major problems, which are in the process, out of desperation, of raising taxes and duties, thereby running the risk of sinking even deeper into crisis.<EOL>
I am pleased that Articles 8a and 8b were removed during the trialogue.<EOL>
With regard to co-development, let us put more effective monitoring systems in place.<EOL>
The European Council to be held 11-12 December 2008 will decide on all the elements linked to this package.<EOL>
It seeks to dodge the one huge issue that is really exercising heads of government across the EU: this is the elephant in the room, and it is called the European Constitution.<EOL>
I welcome the Commission's efforts as regards both international cooperation and internal legislation.<EOL>
Finally, it calls for the political courage to monitor the budget and fight against its misuse.<EOL>
The Commission is aware of the arrest of a Spanish citizen, apparently under the so-called Trading-With-the-Enemy Act.<EOL>
That is a problem.<EOL>
Why the price crisis?<EOL>
This is not sufficient and has to be put on a firmer footing.<EOL>
In particular, in paragraphs 14 to 17, Mr McCartin's report refers to the need to maintain a system of protection for the Community market.<EOL>
Nature is there to be used by the people.<EOL>
Support for and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises would be of service here, since these companies employ a large proportion of European Union citizens.<EOL>
These are undue administrative interference, insufficient respect for the freedom of expression and access of all parties to media, and an overall lack of public confidence in the democratic and electoral process.<EOL>
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which highlights the need to streamline and synchronise procedures for coordinating economic, social and employment policies, not forgetting the environmental dimension, in order to gear them towards a medium and long-term perspective.<EOL>
I trust you will appreciate that such aid could not come out of the agri-environmental budget.<EOL>
   Madam President, there was a time when laws were made by gods; gods made perfect laws.<EOL>
In terms of timing and linking these proposals together, I am really pleased that we now have this major reform, because it will be an indispensable building block of our overall approach.<EOL>
What are these barriers?<EOL>
On the Odessa-Brody-Gdańsk pipeline, I would like to say that the Commission is making every effort to diversify EU energy supplies and routes and, of course, Central Asia is absolutely crucial here.<EOL>
So what are you going to say to the stakeholders in January, Commissioner?<EOL>
These two tranches of EUR 1 500 per Member are controversial and would be difficult at any time, but are, of course, even more controversial in difficult economic times.<EOL>
More than 50% of emissions are not yet included in the Emissions Trading System.<EOL>
Firstly, it is suggested to introduce labels for new cars which specify information such as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.<EOL>
In August 2007 it held parliamentary elections at which I acted as an observer.<EOL>
I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues, such as the possible existence of ‘black sites’ in EU Member States.<EOL>
In addition, the express reference in the Budget that failure to take measures to prevent serious violence against women – and it specifies stoning, public castigation, burning, and rape – justifies the suspension of EU aid.<EOL>
The countless investigations into the tourism industry go right back to 1989 and were carried out by the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament, the Courts and the Commission itself, which is being held fully responsible for the whole affair.<EOL>
This illustrates that it is important for the Member States to introduce well sustained and scientifically based alerts into the RASFF and to trigger the RASFF when Member States are confident regarding the scientific evidence supporting the alert notification.<EOL>
Thirdly, is the Commission planning to classify China as a market economy, even though that is no more justified than it ever has been?<EOL>
He is in favour of liberalisation, but deplores the fact that post offices are being closed down and that the public postal service is deteriorating.<EOL>
I think he makes the Commission slightly more impotent by admitting that Commissioners currently have no political responsibility.<EOL>
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0417/2001) by Mr Pérez Royo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on financial collateral arrangements (COM(2001) 168 - C5-0131/2001 - 2001/0086(COD)).<EOL>
A large part of the EU budget is allocated to establishing and strengthening police agencies, military operations, the creation of immigrant detention facilities, etc.<EOL>
The Dutch and British authorities are currently considering Mr Kazemi's case very carefully.<EOL>
It is now valued at only USD 0.85.<EOL>
It therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of European integration.<EOL>
On the matter of the Channel Tunnel, it is regrettable that last week Eurotunnel cancelled a visit.<EOL>
The abrupt change of direction by the US might well be viewed with a degree of cynicism.<EOL>
<EOL>
In my region, Lorraine, a recent tragic cross-border accident, resulting from a signalling error, dramatically illustrated the urgent need to harmonise the rail network, which is no small challenge.<EOL>
I will give you 30 seconds, but I warn you that it will be 30 seconds only, as a gesture of goodwill, because these really are the last few moments of the parliamentary term.<EOL>
The feed that is given to livestock also plays its part in ensuring that the food that ends up in our supermarkets and on our tables merits our confidence.<EOL>
We cannot have a situation in which recycling is encouraged on the one hand and recycled materials are not permitted onto the market on the other.<EOL>
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has concerns about a soils directive and this is an issue that needs to be carefully examined.<EOL>
I voted in favour of this report because current events should encourage us to reform the neighbourhood policy, not just to refocus it.<EOL>
This was the paradox that I wanted to share with you.<EOL>
Consensus means a universal agreement, but the text adopted did not enjoy such approval.<EOL>
Second, a brief word on China and Russia.<EOL>
(RO) In my view, Hugo Chávez has adopted all the worst possible aspects of totalitarian socialism from the last century.<EOL>
This sets out that farmers and private forest owners can receive compensation for costs incurred and income foregone because of Natura 2000 actions.<EOL>
Likewise, if I may say to Mrs Ghilardotti, the idea that we should begin to develop a jurist prudence of fair-trading in the European Union is a grand one.<EOL>
This applies both to the economic situation and to the political situation. Economically, Burma is on the edge of the abyss.<EOL>
There is a vast grey economy and there is high unemployment, features not entirely unknown in some of the countries that are already European Union Member States.<EOL>
(CS) Mr President, the presence of a very large number of migrant schoolchildren has enormous consequences for the education system.<EOL>
There is also a series of amendments aimed at defining the role of the professional associations dealing with the recognition of qualifications and at setting up a single committee for this purpose.<EOL>
We tried to be as objective as possible.<EOL>
This is a legal monstrosity and a serious denial of democracy.<EOL>

We must also emphasise that not only is military action underway but we are also seriously suggesting that a global solution for the Balkan problem be drawn up, as Chancellor Schröder mentioned again today.

The improvements proposed by the Commission aim to increase its economic rationale and refine its implementation.<EOL>
I believe this is a demand of particular relevance.<EOL>
We have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people' s health, but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed.<EOL>
The Community action plan in the field of health is an important text, in that it aims to safeguard effective prevention, improved health services and a better quality of life for everyone, something that is our primary political objective.<EOL>

Lastly, Madam President, there is the help we need to give the children who have been left orphaned.<EOL>
If the President will allow me, I shall comment very briefly on these issues that I have mentioned, the most important issues to have arisen over the last month, and which are unquestionably going to make up this Parliament’s and the European Union’s fundamental agenda for 2006, but not without firstly saying once again to the Presidency of Parliament and to its Members that there is no question that the European Union is an essential player in international politics, that this must continue to be the case, that experience has shown us that, whether we like it or not, it must be the case, and that over just thirty days we have had to deal with so many issues, and at times this has stopped us being able to think; such has been the activity in which we have been immersed throughout this month.<EOL>
I agree with Mrs Malmström, who has said this is the way to bring people together and enable the citizens of Europe to travel.<EOL>
What happens if a prior solution is not reached for Israel and Palestine?<EOL>
It is still rather early in the process, as we are waiting for the report by the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, which will be submitted sometime around March.<EOL>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be clear that for a variety of reasons, no one in the Netherlands is happy with the conclusions which Mrs McKenna has very clearly and properly outlined: the environmentalists are not happy, the farmers are not happy and the government is not happy.<EOL>

Wolfowitz was not the choice of those most closely involved in the World Bank, but the American President, George W. Bush's, and his alone.<EOL>

As the Commissioner has just said, this directive can be seen as one of the services directives, and it is indeed meant to make the internal market simpler.<EOL>
It goes without saying that Parliament will have to contribute when the Community proceeds with the required proposals, in order to take this issue forward in the near future.<EOL>
The result will be more centralism and more fiddling and, in five years' time, a new Committee of Wise Men will be preparing a new report on increasing fraud within the EU, for it is secretiveness and centralism which give rise to fraud.<EOL>
The task would have to be delegated to the new incoming Parliament.<EOL>
We need to fight discrimination wherever it is found not just in the workplace.<EOL>
I shall no doubt accept the invitation to visit sunny Ireland.<EOL>
Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project.<EOL>
On 30 November, Portuguese boats that currently fish in Morocco will stop doing so.<EOL>
The Union has also concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with all but one of the Euromed countries, and I hope that the negotiations with the remaining country will be concluded soon so that the grid of arrangements can be completed.<EOL>

We visited this centre in Bucharest together with Dr Swoboda, and I should perhaps mention that those who work there include Austrian customs and police officials.<EOL>
In Hungary, since 2004 there have been continual discrepancies of several percentage points between the promised results and the reality that was later acknowledged.<EOL>

Since the crackdown against the civilian population in Alas in November, the news reaching us from East Timor, despite being diluted by the censure of the military authorities, has contained worrying signs of repeated human rights abuses.

Nevertheless, we feel that in order to succeed in this task, we must avoid various topics which crop up on a regular basis in discussions on the subject and we should avoid including them in the text of the resolution.<EOL>
These activities are made easier by the 110 different licence models that are currently in use in the European Union, and let us be honest: we need look no further for an example than Germany, where many drivers still have the collector’s item we call the grey rag; some of these have even paid the occasional visit to a washing machine.<EOL>

The destruction of the ozone layer, the thoughtless wastage of natural resources and the reckless poisoning of the environment play their part in the disaster.<EOL>
What we want to emphasize, however, is that, because the future financial prospects are uncertain, we also need to review the overall financing in the light of the new financial prospects; not only, but, in particular, when the new member countries join, the overall maximum amount will have to be reviewed, because we think this proposal is only adequate for the 15 member countries.<EOL>

I therefore welcome in particular the emphasis which Mr Alyssandrakis has given to this in his report and appreciate the amendments he has tabled to strengthen these aspects still further.<EOL>

It was not easy to reach a political agreement in the Council; under the Slovenian presidency we agreed on some main points, but some points were still shaky.<EOL>
<EOL>

The document states that the Commission consulted a large number of bodies before taking a decision on the common fisheries policy: representatives of the fishermen, representatives of the companies which live off fishing and representatives of the fishing boat equipment companies.<EOL>
Thirdly, these are the only form of negotiations in which smaller developing countries can punch their collective political weight.<EOL>
Member States are therefore free to apply such levies on the obvious condition that they comply with their commitments under the EC Treaty.<EOL>
Today, we discussed the matter of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development when dealing with the modification to the European Commission's 2009 Finance Bill.<EOL>
I would like to point out that we must not be influenced by information which is not only alarmist, but sometimes hasty, with regard to the euro, and that we must not focus solely on the progress of the euro' s parity with other currencies, such as the dollar.<EOL>

Water shortage is one of the new challenges.<EOL>
I am well aware of this, and I say so under the supervision of my colleague and friend, Mr Vitorino, who worked a great deal with you on the previous Convention on fundamental rights: here we are dealing with subjects that are more politically open and probably more problematic.<EOL>
We are expecting definite intervention from the EU.<EOL>
I also hope that the Commission will respond as soon as possible to the request that we sent with Mrs Podimata concerning the long-term measures which will be adopted so that we can actually have, prior to the Spring European Council, a common policy and effective measures that will resolve problems similar to those which have occurred just now and were described today by Mr Barroso as unprecedented, unjustified and incomprehensible.<EOL>

Whether it be the European Securities and Markets Authority (motion for a resolution, the European Banking Authority (motion for a resolution or the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (motion for a resolution, none of the people nominated were women.<EOL>
   Mr President, why do we need specific legislation to implement the Århus Convention?<EOL>

However, I do believe that the Treaty of Amsterdam has given us a margin there, and we must see how we can stimulate it.<EOL>
Mr President, in many contexts the EU is de facto sitting upon quite a lot of countries' ratifications.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that I have been invited to be the first speaker on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, because I think the European City of Culture is a brilliant idea, a real stroke of genius.<EOL>
This would make it possible to actually make a start on allocating resources from the Fund with effect from 1 November, following adoption by the General Council on 21 October.<EOL>
It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application.<EOL>
in writing. - (PT) In addition to the many other issues raised by this resolution that we value, we consider it essential to stress that we unquestionably support the deepening of genuine and effective cooperation and friendship between the countries of the EU and India.<EOL>
The latter continue to protect design like Japan and other major car industry leaders.<EOL>
Members of this House are perfectly entitled to defend themselves against slanders of that sort.<EOL>
At present, the role of women in this process of cooperation is marginal or focused on the economic sector, with negligible results as regards improving their standard of living, whereas our committee believes that such a political vision should consider women to be instrumental in promoting cohesion, peace and sustainable development.<EOL>
There are two considerations.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate all the rapporteurs, Ms Morgan, Mr Chichester, Mr Vidal-Quadras and Ms De Vits, on their excellent reports, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and all the members of the committees involved.<EOL>
Of course I understand that the global economic context is unfavourable, nevertheless I would not like to perceive it as an excuse, but rather as a stimulus for an enlarged European Union to find the answers to those questions which others cannot answer.<EOL>
an oral question - B6-0321/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Joseph Daul, Lutz Goepel and Neil Parish, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission,<EOL>
Mr President, 11 years ago, immediately following his assumption of office, President Alexander Lukashenko made a significant pledge to his Belarussian electorate.<EOL>
Mr President, I believe that democratisation, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights are the cornerstones on which our future relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have to be built.<EOL>
Why are there not also interventions from people who are opposed to the Treaty of Nice and the centralisation of more administrative power in Brussels?<EOL>
<EOL>
Who does not see that the moral lessons addressed to one or another country, the abusive incriminations, the hazardous implications, constitute an inadmissible interference, repeated many times, in the home affairs of the country concerned and, as a result, unlikely to change things for the better?<EOL>
I would like to congratulate him.<EOL>
Consequently, investment must be made in strengthening existing companies.<EOL>
More importance will be attached to investment and we will seek closer coordination and cooperation with the international financial institutions.<EOL>
The Commission is confident that the agreed parts of the text are balanced and that they reflect our needs while addressing Turkey's concerns.<EOL>
Applause<EOL>
I would be grateful if you would create the appropriate political pressure, so that we perhaps advance some way together, because after all this is about the Community's money!<EOL>
All this must be borne in mind.<EOL>
Mr President, I have to say that Mr Rothley has been consistent.<EOL>
We believe that internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO should concern themselves with global world health issues.<EOL>
Particular attention should be given to regulation regarding new financial products, such as sub-prime mortgages and their derivatives, as well as the entities that are involved in their marketing, such as banks, hedge funds and private equity.<EOL>
Participation in the Eastern Partnership is intended to help them realise those rights, and if the Belarusian authorities stand in the way of this they will not be able to count on partnership and good relations with the West, especially not at the high level which Mr Vondra mentioned, and especially not when we are thinking about the Prague Summit in May, which is about the Eastern Partnership.<EOL>
We therefore feel frustration, emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days.<EOL>
We will do that but one way of stopping points of order on the Minutes is not to distribute them.<EOL>
Four hundred and fifty now.<EOL>
Moreover, the introduction of a common framework in this area on the collection, processing, transfer and evaluation of European environmental economic accounts would facilitate the political evaluation of European environmental policy.<EOL>
I now wish in particular, however, to focus the Commissioner's attention on something he has already touched on here, which is how we might be able to get border cooperation to function more efficiently.<EOL>
This can have tragic consequences for the social fabric of any region, but particularly those regions where there is little potential for job creation.<EOL>
As you know, I hope the governments will very soon agree on that and so I hope that there will be a political decision in the European Council confirming the decisions regarding the European Stability Mechanism and, of course, you know what our position is.<EOL>
I have voted in favour of Mrs Peijs' s report and wish to emphasise the quality of the work that our rapporteur produced.<EOL>
Mr Orlov's statements, challenged by President Kadyrov, concerned the fact that the killer of Memorial activist Natalya Estimirova, although identified, has not been brought to justice.<EOL>
We call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights, which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections.<EOL>
The GDP yardstick does not work as well in this particular area because it is too narrow.<EOL>
Firstly, the annual report on the equal treatment of men and women that is required from companies in this directive.<EOL>
It says nothing about the responsibility capitalists have assumed in over-exploiting natural resources.<EOL>
It is very important that these resources should be available not only in an urban but also in a rural environment, in order that they may be used to increase housing supply by renovating as well as building new houses, that the reduction of segregation should be an important goal, and that the approach be an integrated one; thus, it should go hand in hand with educational and occupational programmes, in a way that represents a sustainable, lasting solution.<EOL>
This, moreover, is probably the objective sought by those who are wanting communitarisation.<EOL>
The United States has denied giving subsidies to Boeing, and has said that prior to any negotiations the European Union would as a precondition have to stop giving Airbus the support previously provided under the system of repayable loans.<EOL>
The second important task is to actually define the criteria for each programme underlying the fund’s allocation.<EOL>
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion on the first part - better lawmaking - in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I refer the House to my written opinion, but there are three points to which I attach particular importance.<EOL>
This was a vote eagerly awaited by European citizens, who struggle to understand their governments’ attitudes on this issue.<EOL>
The loss of customs taxes could have significant consequences for useful public spending.<EOL>
President-in-Office of the Council.<EOL>
The financial sector will be excluded and the whole area of food safety legislation will not be covered because it has its own separate legal regime.<EOL>
Was ongoing discrimination taken into account too, along with the fact that as we enter the 21st century a very large area of Europe remains in genuine poverty?<EOL>
The next item is voting time.<EOL>
This goes hand in hand with the destruction of trust in democracy, and the moment the public loses its trust in democracy, democracy is finished.<EOL>
In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important: we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well, and not just its weaknesses.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, it is my pleasure to discuss tax matters with you today, the last day of my mandate as Commissioner responsible for taxation and customs.<EOL>
What we heard, however, was more of the same, and attempts at defending the indefensible.<EOL>
On the other hand, the Commission made it very clear throughout the drafting process that some amendments cannot be taken into account in the current situation, simply because OLAF's present status as a Commission directorate-general does not legally permit such changes.<EOL>
I think Human Rights Watch and the UN's Martin Scheinin achieved such a standard.<EOL>
We know where the powers lie.<EOL>
Workers and young people are calling for something tangible, not for outdated ideologies.<EOL>
The Union has finally understood that we must no longer restrict ourselves to dealing with the damage caused by short-sighted planning only after it has been done.<EOL>
The report by Mrs Castex, for which I congratulate her, falls within a broader perspective - that of the demographic future of Europe.<EOL>
Compromises seldom are.<EOL>
In Vienna, agreement should be reached on the Secretary-General, who should be a visible personification of foreign policy.<EOL>
Fourthly, for producer organisations, financing at a rate of 60% in under-organised areas is positive, but capping at 4.1% of the value of the marketed production is marginal and will not allow them to honour the new, important duties they are taking on.<EOL>
I hope the Commission will take the views of the committee on board.<EOL>
We must not leave the beekeepers to fight this battle on their own.<EOL>
We need a shared commitment to a deep-seated change in Europe's capacity for innovation.<EOL>
For reasons of democracy, we think that what was decided in the Amsterdam Treaty must apply until a new Intergovernmental Conference amends that Treaty.<EOL>
They close the door to the import of pork from throughout the EU if there has been vaccination against foot and mouth disease in one location in the EU.<EOL>
I find this extremely worrying.<EOL>
I shall follow the plan of action closely myself and I insist that we are given regular thorough reports and analyses.<EOL>
There are around twenty thousand dairy farmers in Ireland and thirty thousand people directly employed as a result of this.<EOL>
Brian’s family is not alone: there are many such cases in the UK where people have lost loved ones to such violent deaths, yet no one is punished or held to account publicly in a court of law.<EOL>
Also, present legislation discourages innovation in the feed industry, and that does not benefit farmers either.<EOL>
We are grateful for the summary of the facts, the information communicated to us this morning by the Council and the Commission, and their good will.<EOL>
Moreover, it clearly distinguishes the three remaining uses from the use of oestradiol for growth promotion.<EOL>
Baroness Ashton, the matter is urgent.<EOL>
There is little or no appetite in the Member States for a fully compulsory system from 1 January 2000.<EOL>
The heads of the central banks do not burst the bubbles, but rather are praised when they constantly ensure that the bubbles can continue to grow ad infinitum.<EOL>
We now continue with the debate on the Council and Commission statements on financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference in Monterrey on 21 and 22 March.<EOL>
I cannot say whose name this report bore, I am too humble for that.<EOL>
(The sitting was closed at 1.20 p.m.)<EOL>
I would like to comment on the change in the character of the report from negative to positive.<EOL>
Many problems still have to be sorted out before a final solution is achieved.<EOL>
As a representative of taxpayers in a small net contributor country I cannot endorse European taxation for the purposes of a federal state.<EOL>
Today more than ever, we have to realise that this advertising message is planned, conceived and broadcast to seduce, to be assimilated, to make millions of people react in a specific way.<EOL>
I also have an airport in my constituency so it is a matter of considerable interest to me back home.<EOL>
In this proposal, it is assumed that sales promotions, such as discounts, gifts and games, are conducive to welfare.<EOL>
The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective.<EOL>
seventhly, the creation, to be postponed until 2002 at the latest, of an integrated payment system which will enable us to transform the euro zone into a market with the same rules as domestic markets.<EOL>
I believe that the EU's attention should be still largely paid to the principle of solidarity and instruments for levelling out the income disparities.<EOL>
I am convinced that it is quite possible to set higher demands than the Commission has done, at least in some areas.<EOL>
Like any family, we will have arguments and differences.<EOL>
Mr President, the contentious decision of the Turkish Government is yet another example of Turkey' s total disregard for and blatant violation of maritime law following the Turkish Grand National Assembly authorising the Turkish Government to claim casus belli and to declare war on Greece should Greece exercise its rights to extend its territorial waters in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which only Turkey has refused to sign.<EOL>
The new aid regime certainly takes account of the interests of all Community regions with shipbuilding interests.<EOL>
That is why we have earmarked EUR 45 million for aid for trade in the Oceania region.<EOL>
Subject: Human rights in Cuba<EOL>
Madam President, the debate on the right to televise major sporting events, incorporated in the TV directive, has been good in principle, for it is important that everybody who wishes to do so should be able to follow major sporting events on television.<EOL>
These are things which will also be good for jobs in Europe.<EOL>
Mr President, it is clear that the European Union does not have the power to intervene in the constitutional arrangements of the Member States, no more than it is for the Union to draw up a so-called positive list of parties for whom electors may vote.<EOL>
I hope this will also be borne in mind.<EOL>
Otherwise there is a risk that every new majority in Parliament will try to change history by describing the worst enemies of society, and that the discussion on European history will be used for short-term campaign purposes.<EOL>
In future this particular dimension could be much more evident in cooperation on education and training policies than previously.<EOL>
It would be better if there were no exceptions to the ban on imports.<EOL>
In the environmental field it must be recognised that the European Union has proved itself in protecting the environment, and it has proved its capacity to lead and point the way to the future like no other regional bloc in the world has done.<EOL>
<EOL>
Subject: Cooperation with Afghanistan In its joint position on Afghanistan adopted on 24 January 2000, the European Union condemns human rights violations in that country and in particular discrimination against women.<EOL>
With regard to the current priorities, those already included in the Prince programme are taken up, that is to say, enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice, the establishment of the euro and the role of the European Union in the world.<EOL>
Mauritania is preparing thoroughly for the elections in October.<EOL>
E4 is part of the 'Introduction of natural gas into new regions' section, and deals with the development of gas networks in the regions of Galicia, Extremadura, Andalusia, the south of Valencia and Murcia, and also with a liquefied natural gas facility in Galicia.<EOL>
There is therefore not a safety problem, it is just that the Danish authorities have not notified the EASA of the replies from the airline in question.<EOL>
Finally, the report stresses the need for precise measures and a concrete timetable for their implementation.<EOL>
Only in this way, acting fairly, will we achieve a Europe which lives in peace and prosperity, which is the founding aim of our Community and I believe that this is still our greatest aspiration.<EOL>
We agree with some aspects of this report such as: the need to make greater progress on dealing with the pay gap between women and men; the promotion of entrepreneurship among women; the importance of policies at national level that seeks to promote an improving work-life balance.<EOL>
Perhaps you could explain this, Mr Šefčovič.<EOL>
Almost one in 20 people over the age of 65 suffers from dementia, while it is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans suffer from diseases of this kind.<EOL>
Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament's Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate.<EOL>
We should not count on officials being able to decide about how to make our continent better, instead of allowing a free economy to do this.<EOL>
No one can expect animal-friendly conduct from capital, whose motivation is exploitation and which behaves inhumanely and coarsely even towards people.<EOL>
- Before the vote on the legislative resolution:<EOL>
The report rightly emphasises the legitimacy of India's aspirations to be recognised as a global player.<EOL>
In fact I want to censure this attitude: Commissioner Flynn spoke out against aid to tobacco producers in a rather heated harangue in search of applause from part of this House.<EOL>
I believe that the partnership with the mass media aimed at raising the profile of the European programmes and projects for young people is a key factor in helping us achieve our objectives.<EOL>
The lack of credit is huge and has contributed to the rise in unemployment.<EOL>
Our approach is clear: to be successful, any drive to modernise must take a broad approach.<EOL>
Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled.<EOL>
Our request to the United States was obviously not intended to interfere in the issue of US national security, but to obtain a guarantee regarding compliance with privacy in the handling of personal data.<EOL>
The EU needs to take the lead on this problem.<EOL>
Today's human rights violations contain the seeds of tomorrow's conflicts.<EOL>
The Court also ruled that a new regime should be adopted within a reasonable time.<EOL>
   Mr President, this House should wholeheartedly welcome the referendum held in Spain and the Spanish public’s clear ‘yes’ to the Constitution.<EOL>
Such an approach might well be counterproductive and would cancel out the benefits of dealing with the Roma problem across the board in all the European Union's policies.<EOL>
However, overall, hydrogen powered vehicles have a very low energy efficiency of 20% from source to wheel.<EOL>
Mr President, first of all I want to say thank you to Mr Lavarra for an excellent piece of work in connection with the report.<EOL>
I would like to add that, after the talks with the Commission, I have tabled some new amendments, namely numbers 18, 19, 20 and 21.<EOL>
It was not an easy report.<EOL>
It will then transpire that the Community method is the only viable route to take.<EOL>
That is why I will vote against the report.<EOL>
As emphasised in paragraph 7, even though the Roma make up a pan-European community and a collective effort is therefore needed at European level, the European Commission has not thus far responded to the call made by the European Parliament on 28 January 2008 for it to formulate a European strategy for the Roma, in cooperation with the Member States, in order to enhance coordination and improve the situation of this particular community.<EOL>
An atrocity or a tragedy on the European continent is commemorated in the history books for every single day going back over 227 years.<EOL>
I can assure some of them that we have talked to the European data protection supervisor to ensure that personal data will remain totally confidential.<EOL>
During this critical period, the confidence of our citizens is a vital factor.<EOL>
I am asking you what you intend to do to make Israel give up its plans to cut the West Bank in two by linking Jericho with East Jerusalem, a month before the international conference.<EOL>
Mr President, Mrs Winberg, ladies and gentlemen, I thank everybody for their contribution to this debate.<EOL>
The fact that we are able to adopt this package today is a fine feather in the cap of the Slovenian Presidency.<EOL>
(EL) Madam President, recent clashes in Abyei illustrate just how unfounded celebrations by the USA and the European Union were following the referendum.<EOL>
We have at least two sides represented in this House, with differing attitudes.<EOL>
So cooperation on law and policy is needed at European Union level and international level, based on new conventions and legal instruments, taking account of the principle of subsidiarity and safeguarding the principle of freedom of expression.<EOL>
We are all aware of the role of SMEs, and we often boast of their economic success and the major role they play in creating jobs, but when we are dealing with environmental standards, technical standards and administrative measures, the majority in our Parliament does not pay enough attention to the concerns of entrepreneurs and their special responsibilities. Entrepreneurs take major risks with few guarantees, either in terms of welfare payments and or in terms of retaining their family property.<EOL>
We should also ensure that illegal migrants are returned to their countries.<EOL>
Was it not the forthcoming announcement of joint patrols in Italy and Libya that hastened the departure of boats to Europe in recent weeks?<EOL>
With this in mind, I wish to welcome the initiative tabled by Mr Feio, intended to encourage such actions as devising more controls and monitoring more closely trends in public debt and revenue.<EOL>
As such, the medium-sized and small businesses are the most important economic factor in the European economy.<EOL>
We need to confront them together, but today the Council is not here.<EOL>
The ESA has already made good progress on the development of the European satellites which we need for this system, so the prospects are good.<EOL>
Both large and small States must be able to exercise influence in the future EU.<EOL>
On the other hand, with this agreement, we risk introducing subsidies for Korean exports.<EOL>
Let me now comment briefly on the security problems faced by Estonia as a neighbour of Russia.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
I welcome the legislation we have adopted as it respect these imperatives.<EOL>
For example, faced with German economic nationalism, you chickened out.<EOL>
He now finds himself on death row for these three reasons and I think it would be a marvellous signal if a country like the United States, which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, were to abolish the death penalty and free Moumia Abou Jamal.<EOL>
They are more demanding of the authorities in their countries.<EOL>
I hope the debate will be useful, fruitful and influence our votes next week in committee, because if it does not we will all have wasted four hours of our time.<EOL>
But I feel sure that you, Sir, as a distinguished member of the Bureau, having taken a most wise decision, will find it possible to adjust the situation to meet cases like mine, and that is why I rather expanded on the position.<EOL>
In this regard, I sincerely hope that our words are followed by actions.<EOL>
Mr President, all the very valuable reports before us tonight deal with agreements and treaties on how best to regulate and control fishing in national and international waters at a time when there are very considerable concerns about over fishing and reduction of fish-stocks.<EOL>
If these are described, then we can also conclude that there are areas where we also need an External Energy Representative.<EOL>
Fourthly, we need to help with the process of repatriation: immediate repatriation of people who do not qualify for asylum protection.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, they say that every era and every generation creates an image that defines its relationship with nature.<EOL>
But I wonder if I can push the Commissioner slightly on one point: during the four or perhaps five years between one election observation mission and the next, does the EU actually offer specific help and suggestions to address any deficiencies or areas where we think that there may be a need to improve and that we can offer ideas, support and perhaps finance to make sure that countries do not repeat in one election the errors they may have made before?<EOL>
Each database is therefore closely linked to the specific type of operational support that Europol can offer pursuant to the powers vested in it.<EOL>
After that, there will be no producers left, just consumers who have no means to consume, and it will only remain for them to be eliminated.<EOL>
It is the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, there are peaceful developments between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East – something that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago – and President Yushchenko is here with us today – from an eastern part of the neighbourhood where democracy and human rights are increasingly being asserted.<EOL>
According to reports on Swedish radio, the Swedish security police is recording details of people who are critical of the EU ahead of the EU summit in Gothenburg.<EOL>
So, I think it would be very interesting and necessary to see what is actually happening in this chain, so let us get this transparency on the table and let us, internally in the Commission, but also in Member States' competition authorities, look into the market.<EOL>
Allow me to link the Pérez Royo report to the Cox report, which we have just debated.<EOL>
Migration can be regarded as a threat, as has been amply illustrated in recent times by the writings of Oriana Fallaci.<EOL>
As regards the international agencies, we have to ensure that the UNHCR's repatriation programme is allowed to continue without any kind of disruption, because there have been a number of incidents in recent times which point to a deliberate attempt to try and disrupt the UNHCR's repatriation programme.<EOL>
rapporteur for an opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.<EOL>
What shall we do?<EOL>
Eighteen of the 27 Members of the EU have not yet reached this landmark.<EOL>
It is important that consumers receive information that is correct, not deceptive, and that is up-to-date and unambiguous.<EOL>
Amendment of the agenda<EOL>
Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government.<EOL>
I support Mr Turmes, our rapporteur, in his attempt to counteract false information about green power or misuse of money for termination of nuclear energy, but that is insufficient.<EOL>
It is very serious.<EOL>
There is a protocol to the Treaty of Maastricht which ensures that EU law will not override Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution on the protection of the unborn.<EOL>
In 2001, a fresh inquiry was opened following a claim, but the investigation did not yield proof of the alleged facts.<EOL>
We hope that this study will come up with sound evidence which might indicate that the CE mark in its present form does not give consumers all the information they need.<EOL>
Thirdly, we call for action to ensure that the invention of innovative financial mechanisms - such as ETS-based derivatives or debt-for-nature swaps - does not in fact conceal fresh financial speculation similar to the very serious crisis from which we have not yet emerged.<EOL>
We can also propose cooperation principally orientated, within the framework of the association agreement, in favour of reconstituting the social fabric, so that Algeria can one day have the intermediary bodies and mediation authorities necessary for the operation of a democracy.<EOL>
<EOL>
However, sterling work has been done, and we should be able to say so once in a while.<EOL>
However, we should be careful.<EOL>
Finally, I should like to mention that many of the roots of our European culture lie in Central and Eastern Europe.<EOL>
Reforms are necessary, though.<EOL>
Firstly, we must administer a shock treatment to bring the patient out of his current coma.<EOL>
Today, this initiative is a reference point for mothers and an example which has been followed in various European countries and elsewhere, in Canada and in Japan, where mothers are setting up similar websites with positive, specific results in the application of new methods to deal with their children's physical and mental health problems.<EOL>
The railway undertakings would thus be restricted to a role of service providers ensuring the traction of trains.<EOL>
In truth, in the longer term, there is a degree of risk that, in order to combat the mafioso inclinations which arise from clientelism and organized fraud, we might get to the stage, as Mrs Theato wished, where we wanted to set up a European public ministry or a European judicial authority, to return to the terminological debate between the British and the Germans.<EOL>
Now, all of this is going to be recorded and analysed.<EOL>
We have worked with specific countries, offering EU support, at delegation and headquarters levels, working with Member States and the EU Presidency.<EOL>
On Iraq, the damage to transatlantic relations arising from the 'gang of four' summit, attended by Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, also severely undermined NATO.<EOL>
The PPE-DE Group launched the debate on the medium-term approach with a parliamentary hearing last week, quite rightly to look at the question in more depth and to bring the citizens and regions into focus in the coming years.<EOL>
Clearly, this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy.<EOL>
For what we need is a broader plan of action, a better strategy which, apart from the sea itself, will include its drainage area, which currently, as we all know, is suffering severe flooding.<EOL>
That is why I support the rapporteur, Mr Nobilia, in this field, as he goes further than the Commission.<EOL>
I would like somebody here in this House to explain to me how the market can be said to be functioning when the cost to operators for transferring a text message from one country to another is less than 11 cents, while the average consumer has to pay more than 28 cents.<EOL>
Finally, it is not envisaged that the Community as such will ratify the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption which is mentioned in the question, as its Member States are ratifying this convention.<EOL>
Levels of safety and performance of the various national automatic train protection systems are different, as are the rules concerning equipment of lines and locomotives in these national systems.<EOL>
It should also encourage Libyans to make changes and to move towards democracy.<EOL>
What value, for example, are telematics health services or the famous European health card to these people?<EOL>
On the first question, we have always left the doors open in the Commission - we are debating the matter after all.<EOL>
Equally - this is a supplementary question to the Commission -, on the issue of the compulsory return of refugees from Thailand to Burma, is humanitarian aid continuing there, guaranteed by the EU?<EOL>
EU citizens must have access to protection and assistance from their own countries, via their diplomatic missions and consulates (Article 3 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Article 1 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations) and, under the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, additional diplomatic and consular protection beyond the borders of the European Union, which stems from their status as EU citizens.<EOL>
However, I should like to ask you whether you plan to research or analyse, from the Commission point of view, the decision by the United Kingdom and other countries to open up their labour markets to free movement of labour immediately, as opposed to those countries which impose restrictions.<EOL>
We need to intervene in this matter.<EOL>
The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect, of course, but is an initial step in the right direction.<EOL>
It is not enough to enact laws and sanction cooperation agreements.<EOL>
The Commission and other EU institutions have so far had far too few women.<EOL>
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, come what may, the text is well balanced, meets the requirements for health and safety work and maintains the required balance in relation to business competitiveness.<EOL>
You cannot deny, however, that most ACP countries have a very inadequate negotiating capacity and are sometimes left with no choice, presented with a fait accompli.<EOL>
Today, principally as a result of economic problems in these countries, accompanied by uncontrolled market speculation, the credibility of the euro is being seriously undermined, creating widespread public concern and uncertainty in Europe according to national surveys.<EOL>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.<EOL>
We are calling for the environmental issues so crucial to the future of Europe to be taken into account in all projects.<EOL>
He envisages globally integrated measures - in other words, not just using more advanced techniques for engine production, but considering aspects such as better quality fuel, traffic management, the promotion of public transport - which is being neglected -, trans-European transport networks and alternative fuels.<EOL>
I do, however, support the paragraph that tries to clarify the points of agreement<EOL>
Progress can be seen in terms of the declarations made by the European Union's members.<EOL>
In connection with this, the Council is discussing a draft of the conclusions relating to mobile criminal groups in a very controversial way, and without informing the European Parliament of this initiative.<EOL>
We do, however, have one fundamental objection to the approach that has been outlined, because the concept of tax harmonisation is federalist in nature and touches on one of the fundamental pillars of state sovereignty: a state’s ability to tax families and businesses, thus ensuring its autonomy.<EOL>
I also think it is immoral that we are buying up all the energy potential in the world, because we have the resources to do so, when we could be leaving the countries that do not have the resources – by which I mean the developing countries – at the end of their tether.<EOL>
Fourthly, the measures contravene European legislation on data collection and processing, such as the Schengen Convention.<EOL>
According to the Council, these should ensure that a high level of safety is maintained and can be improved, when reasonably practicable and taking into account the competitiveness of the rail transport mode.<EOL>
I say this as a Federalist, and as somewhat not in favour of the multiplication of states.<EOL>
Over the years grants for organisations have become established to the extent that their allocation has been something that former recipients of aid have taken for granted.<EOL>
As Mr Ramón de Miguel stressed, the possibility of escalation can never be excluded in a military conflict.<EOL>
It does, however, represent a step towards establishing a new international structure based on respect for fundamental rights and political freedoms.<EOL>
This is because considerable quantities of oil have been found in Cambodia and we are now experiencing something we often have to deal with in human rights debates, namely that the Chinese and Japanese - the Chinese above all - are prepared to invest there and produce oil whatever the political conditions, ignoring questions of human rights, and that western groups - the United States of America in particular in this case - unfortunately then also join this negative race.<EOL>
B5-0111/2001, by Mr Van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Chechnya;<EOL>
Furthermore, good information is necessary for the functioning of a democratic constitutional state.<EOL>
This protection is usually known as legal privilege.<EOL>
I welcome joint initiatives to combat tax havens, as well as practices that intensify international dialogue between the relevant countries.<EOL>
There will be an EU-US Summit on 3 November and the Europeans have a special responsibility.<EOL>
We believe that it must be possible for individual European citizens to log on to the Internet and see how the EU's money has been allocated to agricultural funds, structural funds and so on.<EOL>
The new financial programme for the development of the New Independent States and Mongolia that is replacing TACIS is bringing in mechanisms that are more precise than the previous ones.<EOL>
Furthermore, although the reform seeks to confer powers to enable rapid action to be taken in the event of serious violations of human rights, the UNHRC failed to deliver an opinion on the situation in Darfur, the attacks on civilians in Sri Lanka, or the consequences of the violence in Lebanon and the occupied territories.<EOL>
In particular, I am very much concerned about oil plants and similar facilities which cause a severe risk to our coastal regions.<EOL>
States not only have the duty to protect their citizens against terrorism, but also must be able to take every measure to safeguard public order.<EOL>
The Commission supports the work of the Ituri Pacification Commission and has been actively trying to bring the parties together.<EOL>
I shall conclude, Mr Barroso, by urging you not to sacrifice the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy because you think it makes us less competitive.<EOL>
These new illiterates cannot even understand safety instructions at work.<EOL>
The European Union's new policy on the use of pesticides is an important step towards better health and environmental protection.<EOL>
The Council and Commission are not competing, but cooperating fully and deeply for stability and democracy in the Western Balkans.<EOL>
Reform of EU agricultural aid is therefore more necessary than ever.<EOL>
The sooner this is done, the better.<EOL>
I think others too will be amazed by the European Commission's brevity.<EOL>
But, unlike Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the African, Caribbean and Pacific House of that Assembly are not constantly in session, and the structures are not there to cope with that level of scrutiny.<EOL>
(RO) I wish to begin by congratulating Pál Schmitt for the coherent and relevant report on the current situation in higher education.<EOL>
It must be possible to compare the work undertaken by a woman caring for the elderly with that of a builder.<EOL>
I would also warn against taking the voluntary approach.<EOL>
It is important that we understand that the Union could save up to 20% of its current energy consumption.<EOL>
Their only possibility of joining the EU is together with Romania, and accession would enable them to live happily with us in a common Europe without borders.<EOL>
If it is possible to reduce sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions in another way than by reducing the sulphur content, that is naturally to be welcomed.<EOL>
Regarding the comments made by Mr Van Rompuy, I usually do not comment on comments.<EOL>
Enlargement will hopefully bring with it some common sense on this score.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
As Mr Herman said, we need to speed up the time limits and say which regulations need altering urgently.<EOL>
This report confirms the importance of fisheries management based on up-to-date, accurate scientific knowledge of stock status.<EOL>
Instead I would like to mention the reason for the change in the central parity, which the German Members presented as a negative phenomenon.<EOL>
Some people outside North Korea sing the praises of the remarkable successes that have been publicised by its regime.<EOL>
The leaders in Moscow much prefer the idea of turning Channel 6 into a special sports channel.<EOL>
I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission has checked, with the legal service, whether the proposals before us are compatible with the ‘insurance’ directive.<EOL>
In my opinion the renewed support for the irreplaceable role of nuclear energy is a good thing, despite the diametrically opposing views on this form of energy even within the political group to which I belong.<EOL>
In conclusion, however, today we are sitting in a Parliament that represents 25 countries and not 15, and the credit for this is yours, Mr Prodi.<EOL>
Without appropriate clothing and shoes, water and electricity at home, and without school supplies, they did not have a chance to finish even primary school.<EOL>
I was forced to ask them to consider themselves as asylum seekers, which meant that they were forced to stay in my town.<EOL>
Secondly, the particular nature of the obstacles to free movement of goods which this regulation is designed to eliminate should be borne in mind.<EOL>
Mr Costa has proposed changes aimed at simplification, such as transferring Article 14 of Annex VII to the directive on interoperability.<EOL>
Finally, the third important issue is of an international order.<EOL>
Anyway, I hope that by tomorrow, my dear colleagues in the PPE, you will have come to your senses on this.<EOL>
That is, they cannot elect the governments of the Member States but they can elect that of the European Union.<EOL>
I look forward to continuing to work with you in an open and constructive manner.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that Mr Watts has to campaign in the United Kingdom until 1 May.<EOL>
They will, especially via the Internet as well, be able to call up much more information than before. This will benefit Parliament's reputation and that of the European institutions, and it is also particularly valuable for the democracy in Europe in general.<EOL>
It is not true of all the African leaders.<EOL>
Rapid results may be achieved through investments in intelligent cities and in energy efficiency in buildings, especially homes.<EOL>
The European Union must adopt a strong position on regional policy.<EOL>
It is in everyone’s interest that we make rapid progress on finalising the reform of the Pact in order to offer greater transparency and predictability regarding public finances and budgetary developments.<EOL>
The match that is being played out in Chechnya has a significance that extends well beyond that territory: its outcome, whether positive or negative, will be felt throughout the Caucasus and will thus affect the overall security of the continent.<EOL>
Let us discuss that in the context of the quality paper that is actually on the table at the moment.<EOL>
But will the Commissioner agree with me that the South Korean Free Trade Agreement actually provides as many opportunities for European textile manufacturers as threats, and indeed gives our quality textiles access to the Korean market?<EOL>
It is about creating a momentum for competition and growth and creating a clear political will.<EOL>
Mr President, you have just said that we will be starting at half past eleven tomorrow.<EOL>
Lastly, I want to go on record again in thanking Mr De Rossa for his report, thanking the Committee on Petitions and thanking this House for its support.<EOL>
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, last year was a year of crucial decisions on climate change and energy policy.<EOL>
Secondly, we urge the Chinese Government to enter into constructive dialogue with the Dalai Lama.<EOL>
Comitology concerns the way in which technical decisions arising from directives are made, and we have a choice: either these decisions can be made publicly, so that members of the public can see what these decisions are and can understand them; or we can make these decisions behind closed doors so that you, the public, do not hear what is being said and so that you, the public, do not understand what decisions are being made and the whole thing is kept under wraps.<EOL>
Even when we look at the agenda of the part-sessions of the next six months until July 1998, in general nothing about the scheduling has changed.<EOL>
Mr President, it is, of course, essential to develop a European research area, but this must not operate simply in areas neglected by the Member States.<EOL>
It is not going to be enough simply to refer it to an advisory committee which already exists.<EOL>
Perhaps we should be told whether the agreement is likely to continue for the Comoros in this way or whether it will be subsumed in a larger series of negotiations.<EOL>
Within this framework, it is necessary to emphasise that important elements are not only the adaptation of legislation in relation to the Copenhagen criteria, but also its material application.<EOL>
The Greek Communist Party voted against the report.<EOL>
An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights.<EOL>
I think we need to learn from this: we need to abide by the rules we already have and we need to develop and improve the Stability and Growth Pact and make it more able to meet crises in the future.<EOL>
With regard to the space of external security, we agreed with the Russians during the summit that closer cooperation should make it possible to work together to reach a peaceful conclusion to what are known as ‘frozen’ conflicts affecting our common neighbourhood or, rather, to use the wording that was finally used in the conclusions, ‘the regions adjacent to Russia and the European Union’.<EOL>
The downward trend in interest rates is resulting in an adjustment of the monthly surcharges on the intervention price for cereals and rice and on the storage cost compensation for sugar.<EOL>
This is happening in a sometimes disorderly fashion, responding to big challenges as we go; currently, for example, the situation of the Greek financial system.<EOL>
Therefore, I will be signing on behalf of my group to ensure that the new states in this union can rely on the union.<EOL>
I would just like to ask you about the Austrian Presidency's programme for strengthening the neighbourhood policy, particularly with regard to Ukraine.<EOL>
Please support it and resist attempts to introduce any amendments on key issues at this stage, which is likely to cause more harm than good.<EOL>
We will now proceed with the debate, and I extend a very warm welcome not only to the President of the European Council, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also to Mr José Manuel Barroso, the President of the Commission.<EOL>
   Mr President, the EU is in crisis in terms of direction and legitimacy, and Mr Blair is now under challenge to fill the leadership vacuum, with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder weakened domestically and probably on their way out.<EOL>
But let us not forget that the Member States regulate this matter, and therefore this regulation is not enough unless it is accompanied by active government policy. Without promoting cooperation between the police and the judicial authorities, it might be possible to limit the excesses, but it would not be possible to put an end to the illegal activities.<EOL>
This amendment has been approved by the main political parties.<EOL>
They will be the basis for our future work.<EOL>
We need to stand by the victims and their families and make a frank declaration of solidarity.<EOL>
That was a reply that did no justice whatever to this resolution.<EOL>
What we have, then, is a report that intends to expand liberalisation in basic sectors in order to improve people's living conditions, but without thinking about the effects on employment, prices and people's lives.<EOL>
I would welcome sensible regulations and awareness campaigns which aim to minimise the risks involved.<EOL>
That concludes the explanations of vote.<EOL>
I am glad that we managed to ensure that its scope is now extended to all rail passengers, especially of course to domestic railways and not just to passengers in international rail services.<EOL>
Many Member States will find it difficult to reconcile their current situation with the provisions proposed in this regulation, and we therefore think it appropriate that the proposed measures should be phased in gradually.<EOL>
This draft decision of the Council and the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado make a good impression: utopia, the need for proximity, the idea that we could move towards a European democracy, that we could have someone at the top of the list who would be president of the Commission; all these ideas are as far from reality as utopia was from the ideas of the contemporaries of Thomas More.<EOL>
When I met her this morning - I did not see her last night for I was here, in this Chamber, speaking on this report - she asked me: "But Daddy, is it true that you want to become an astronaut and go to the moon?<EOL>
With regard to category 1 B, I appreciate that the Council has adopted Parliament' s amendment in order to achieve a quality policy for European agricultural products.<EOL>
We have therefore, quite obviously, voted against this report.<EOL>
Compulsory elements must be incorporated during the debate on the revision of the structural funds, so that Member States respect this principle or face financial penalties.<EOL>
What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C' s.<EOL>
The large majority of my group will approve the interinstitutional agreement on medium-term financial planning and we will of course give our assent to those parts of Agenda 2000 that require such assent.<EOL>
As other people have said, we need to bring pressure to bear to try and bring the parties together to endeavour to reach a peaceful solution.<EOL>
(PT) We can move forward together.<EOL>
I think this is also a very important contribution to the increased transparency and higher quality of the EU legislative process.<EOL>
The European Parliament also shares these concerns.<EOL>
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and all those who contributed to the success of the negotiations; thanks to you we will at last be able to vote on this issue tomorrow.<EOL>
When the regime change came about, our countries, including Romania, were unprepared as regards environmental protection strategies.<EOL>
We need some proper indicators and markers there, which may be done by voluntary agreement, but I do think that this needs to be a wide-ranging and ambitious proposal.<EOL>
(Applause)<EOL>
The rules can be clarified in the form of the Agreement now being prepared, and it would be wise to approve it.<EOL>
The European Union, which is so ambitious regarding this fight against climate change.<EOL>
During these last five years, the Commission's commitment to gender equality has been formalised in the roadmap for equality between women and men.<EOL>
Relieving the sector's situation in the short term, with measures like that proposed by the Commissioner of mobilising and encouraging the mobilisation of the European Fisheries Fund, seems positive to me, and I believe it should be compatible with other measures and long-term action toward greater stability.<EOL>
If we refuse the interim agreement, it means that we have a good base for negotiating the final agreement.<EOL>
Mr President, this report goes to the core of what people think they are getting from the European Union.<EOL>
I am grateful to everyone, including my colleagues from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, who contributed to the directive.<EOL>
Three to four years ago, there was a huge forest fire in Russia, resulting in massive smoke damage in my own country, Finland.<EOL>
All this must be combined with other forms of management that permit a fairer reward for the work carried out by professionals in this sector, a group of people who need to progress and continue learning throughout their working lives.<EOL>
EU cooperation with Russia on upgrading the safety of nuclear power must become more effective.<EOL>
At the same time, the creation of a new international legal order with appropriate means for 'humanitarian intervention' is coming up against the implacable opposition of the major powers, including the United States, with regard to reforming the UN, and the opposition of the United States, Russia, France and China to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.<EOL>
I received my doctorate from the Sorbonne when I was already the mother of three children and my husband had four.<EOL>
You will thus assess the tangible and visible consequences of the extreme ultraliberal, ultra-internationalist and ultra-immigrationist economic policy carried out for the past 25 years by the European institutions and the Member States, with France at the helm.<EOL>
I would appeal to you, Commissioner, to take particular account of what Mr Désir has said, but also of what the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and some of the Members on the left have said.<EOL>
Our first duty, as I see it today, will be to demand full recognition of the new responsibilities which the Amsterdam Treaty has assigned to the European Parliament and which must, without delay or hesitation on the part of the other institutions, be translated into deeds.<EOL>
There is no real reason for the state to be involved.<EOL>
The preliminary findings of our review point exactly in the same direction.<EOL>
The amendments were in fact rejected, but I nevertheless voted in favour of adoption of the document as a whole, because increasing milk quotas by 2% is at least a step in the right direction, even if it is too small a step.<EOL>
Furthermore, this is a prerequisite for the Mediterranean to remain at the centre of the world stage; unless this condition is met, we might become more African, Mediterranean or European, but have only a minor role to play in the twenty-first century world.<EOL>
It is now my hope that Parliament will adopt these principles laid down by a strong majority.<EOL>
So, if your staff were aware of it, then, by implication, you were aware of it.<EOL>
The Commission's mandate is for the running of the European Union and yet there seem to be some in this House who would have it closed down for the summer.<EOL>
For example, although it is directly critical of the Socialist government of Cuba for repressing 'free' journalism, it is particularly polite and cautious in the case of Turkey and Ukraine, even though it is a well-known fact that dozens of journalists are in prison in Turkey and that a journalist was murdered during the last round of elections in Ukraine.<EOL>
The flood situation was prefigured by April 2010, which was the warmest April since 1880 from the point of view of average global air temperature.<EOL>
Giving farmers greater powers to make their own decisions concerning vaccinations is a welcome boost to the farming industry in Wales and will ensure that livestock can be exported without the current restrictions.<EOL>
As Mr Cox said, it is destroying consumer confidence.<EOL>
This is the second problem.<EOL>
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead.<EOL>
It could be laid down in the law, in the interest of the environment, that dashboards for cars should be made of such and such products.<EOL>
Nor can we accept the extensive efforts already made by the European Union in the area of agriculture being repudiated, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations.<EOL>
Therefore, Mr Poettering, it makes no sense to issue vetoes prematurely.<EOL>
The statement protects the right of people to protest, which is one of the fundamental issues that people were very concerned about.<EOL>
We are sorry that our proposal to include representatives of the NGOs and trade unions on the administrative board were rejected.<EOL>
Parliament - by which I mean, we - should not always deny ourselves our rights in the legislative process.<EOL>
The European Union must respond to the current situation in a forceful manner.<EOL>
Many thanks, President Sarkozy.<EOL>
In the case of bus and coach transport, this report recognises the need for additional measures for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.<EOL>
Indeed, for a few years now, we have once again been observing a tendency for regional disparities to increase, particularly in the field we are considering today.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the outgoing Commission showed above all that a more democratic balance of power was needed between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is, I think, obvious - and here I disagree with many of my honourable friends - that, if nothing else, the Lisbon process, the Lisbon strategy, is not a total failure.<EOL>
All of us who, on various occasions, meet official representatives of Iran, are also met with more severity and implacability.<EOL>
The Commission’s 2005 comprehensive monitoring report on Romania, to which the honourable Member refers, is still being examined by the Council.<EOL>
Restrictive red tape for small independent businesses is the last thing we currently need in Europe.<EOL>
Just as SADC is beginning to understand that Mugabe's regime is a problem, so the ACP is also stirring.<EOL>
My other point is this: now is the time to consider the harmonization of penalties and their application throughout the whole Community, so that drivers penalized, say, in England, Wales or France are not still able to drive in Germany or Belgium.<EOL>
We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliament's motion for a resolution, but we have to see - and this is at stake - the tactical nature.<EOL>
However, there is still a dangerous mismatch between the continuing police approach to illegal immigration and the reality in numerous Member States.<EOL>
However, action is needed to ensure that reserves are turned into actual supplies.<EOL>
In its work on its proposal on the fight against counterfeit medicines, the Commission has been guided precisely by the deliberations presented by you, honourable Members.<EOL>
It is difficult to maintain that the Council should consult the European Parliament before every meeting of the Joint Committee.<EOL>
Secondly, to take note of the fact that the days when the European Parliament simply rubber-stamped the priorities established by other Community institutions have finally been assigned to history.<EOL>
Those secondary aspects that divide us politically to an extent that is not insurmountable must not be allowed to prevent this approval.<EOL>
European common trade policy is an integral and important part of the Union's general external action.<EOL>
Unfortunately, circumstances demonstrate that more must be done and, without prejudice to the measures to assist victims, which the Council has approved, I would like to express our desire for the financial contribution for the pilot project to help victims to be significantly increased, raising the status of that project to a wide-ranging Community action.<EOL>
How is it possible that this protocol was not submitted to the European Parliament until mid-October 2005, 10 months after the commencement of the agreement and two weeks after the first payment was due?<EOL>
My main aim, with my vote, was to prioritise support for the European recovery plan, for the launch of a new initiative on micro-credit (EUR 25 million in 2010) and for emergency aid for the milk sector (EUR 300 million).<EOL>
It is time to give Parliaments' Resolution tangible form.<EOL>
Despite initial scepticism, the Convention has managed to strike an admirable compromise.<EOL>
There is, therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies.<EOL>
Far from it!<EOL>
- Report: Neil Parish (A6-0373-2007)<EOL>
Mr Frattini rightly praised the Council and the initiative of the Committee on Legal Affairs.<EOL>
The current text actually provides for the possibility of looking at the issue again in 2011.<EOL>
Conclusions of the G8 meeting in Genoa<EOL>
Last December, at the time of the emergency package for Korea, on Christmas Eve, in the hours before the Nativity, four Member States of the Union, the four members of the G7, were called on to provide bilateral aid to the country in question, which was essential to enable Korea to complete the year.<EOL>
The Eurosystem, early on, made it clear to the public at large that frontloading over a short period would not be a problem provided it could be ensured that the money frontloaded to banks, for instance, or other organisations is not brought into circulation before 1 January 2000 - into general circulation that is.<EOL>
Practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally. That is why room must be made for local players.<EOL>
The practices which will be developed in relations between the permanent President of the European Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on the one hand, and other Community institutions and leaders of Member States, on the other, depend in large measure on the Presidency which is just beginning.<EOL>
I therefore feel that this is a good proposal which will cut through a lot of red tape and offer safeguards to society.<EOL>
the report by Edit Herczog, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge for implementation of the budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2005 [C6-0400/2006 -, and<EOL>
The agreed interest for late payment, the reference rate plus 8%, is acceptable, but the EUR 40 minimum recovery charge might become seen as excessive for small and, for example, repeat deliveries.<EOL>
This is obviously all about US interests.<EOL>
As so often, the women out number the men in these late-night debates, but that does not diminish their contribution.<EOL>
And his view that this is primarily a legal and economic question rather than one of public health is quite outrageous and irresponsible.<EOL>
The position taken by the majority in the European Parliament directly opposes that held by the same political forces six months ago on the Kosovo issue.<EOL>
Let us be clear: the suggestion of a 5% increase is completely unacceptable and the idea of so-called own resources is equally unacceptable - it is just a power-grab by the EU.<EOL>
    There has been mention of the budget for 2007-13.<EOL>
Firstly, the report introduces what is really a new element, namely the important and sometimes very controversial question of who pays for aviation security.<EOL>
We want to see greater progress made on the issue of international harmonization of standards.<EOL>
What we have seen this morning has been reminiscent of the old Soviet times.<EOL>
My group firmly believes that the United Nations must be involved or brought back into the process.<EOL>
I think that we must call a halt to this.<EOL>
His job must be taken over immediately by the Vice-President.<EOL>
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.<EOL>
Georgia's appeal to the international community and international organisations to consider the possibility of replacing the Russian 'peace-keeping' forces with another format ought to be taken into consideration and supported by the Council and the European Commission, which should also examine the possibility of providing a peace-keeping mission under EU supervision in Georgia's Abkhazia region.<EOL>
In addition, we need to realise that, on this road, which is without doubt the one that we Europeans intuitively wish to take, we risk finding ourselves very much alone at times, because I cannot see many developing countries taking the same route.<EOL>
It was this agency that is being accused by numerous insurance funds that lost their investments due to erroneous ratings.<EOL>
For years UNSCOM has been destroying weapons of mass destruction and the investigation is being constantly obstructed.<EOL>
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Sartori report on a roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010).<EOL>
I disagreed with this and supported the draft report in committee.<EOL>
The new contribution agreement of EUR 60 million has just been finalised.<EOL>
This is an unpleasant and embarrassing matter.<EOL>
However, given that the financial contribution of the countries of the South is, if not non-existent, then no more than purely symbolic, our solidarity becomes indispensable to overcome this shortfall.<EOL>
Member States should be encouraged to apply long-term political strategies on air pollution on a voluntary basis.<EOL>
The first guest to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was the Grand Mufti of Damascus in January.<EOL>
The absurdity becomes apparent when Danish economic policy is compared with that pursued in the eleven euro or EMU countries.<EOL>
Traceability is essential.<EOL>
In my opinion, Mrs Rothe has succeeded in presenting the effect of renewable energy sources on employment and regional policy quite well in her report.<EOL>
The political centre is where the ideas tearing economic and monetary union apart are generated.<EOL>
For example, in Finland, a country where distances are long and the population is sparse, a passenger car is not exactly a luxury, but a necessity for working people and their families.<EOL>
Our fellow citizens want to see a more social dimension and joint action that is more effective.<EOL>
We would call on the Council, when Regulation (EEC) No 1210/90 is next revised, to adopt the European Parliament's amendments. This would enable the European Environment Agency to provide reports on the application of waste management legislation in the Member States, while increasing its cooperation with national governments.<EOL>
We often talk about how our citizens do not understand our complicated Europe.<EOL>
One further area which will need to be watched carefully is the need for the new Legislative Council to pass legislation on issues such as subversion and treason under Article 23 of the Basic Law.<EOL>
This is the best way because it is what the animals are used to.<EOL>
If we want a more competitive labour market, we must restructure the social security systems and support more flexible working practices.<EOL>
Community law already contains regulations concerning the labelling of threshold values for unintentional occurrence.<EOL>
That is not relevant and it has nothing directly to do with human rights.<EOL>
in writing. - (SV) The June List takes a very critical view of this report and the compromise which is being supported by certain political parties.<EOL>
It was only in March 1996 that I was able to forward the Commission's modified proposal to the Council, because before the Staff Regulations can be amended, extensive consultations are required, particularly with staff representatives.<EOL>
I would further like to encourage the Commission to push ahead with the CCTB as a longer-term solution, which I hope will also be supported by this House in this report.<EOL>
I welcome the fact that the Commission has learned from the mistakes of the past and accepted a deadline for comitology and for the tabling of the implementing measures.<EOL>
On 8 October 2003, the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on the presidential elections in Chechnya.<EOL>
I believe it is very important that, throughout this process of electing the President of the Commission, we remember the spirit of Lisbon.<EOL>
In accordance with the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, which are fundamental principles of the Union, cohesion policy should support those regions which have the greatest distance to make up in terms of infrastructure, the economy, technology, employment or social integration and which, on the strength of their own resources, are unable to bridge this gap.<EOL>
It is our duty to protect the interests of passengers by encouraging more small airlines to set up and expand and by not allowing large airlines to completely dominate the market by wiping out all competition.<EOL>
Neither increased competition nor reduced indirect costs will lead to a substantial reduction in prices, as is demonstrated by the experience of liberalization and the granting of tax and other, financial, advantages.<EOL>
We have also, however, emphasised the need for this process to be accompanied by measures guaranteeing democratic and legal control.<EOL>
However, this report seems to set the barrier of membership of Turkey at a higher level than other states.<EOL>
Up to now we have mainly provided donations, but this time it is a loan.<EOL>
However, I am absolutely opposed to the creation of supranational authorities - such as EUROPOL is intended to be - which, as one of my colleagues said of the Fundamental Rights Agency, is one of the attributes of statehood that the European Union is claiming.<EOL>
That is something we can discuss.<EOL>
It is a fascinating dossier and impressive in terms of the result.<EOL>
Thirdly, restrictions in the area of CO2 emissions will only weaken humanity economically, and so will make the catastrophe worse.<EOL>
Now, checks should no longer be carried out because of special events, but because of a phenomenon.<EOL>
The EU has agreed new targets on energy efficiency and renewables and CO2 emissions.<EOL>
The first opportunity for the period 2007 to 2013 will be the debate on the first interim report on the implementation of the cohesion policy.<EOL>
However, I am pleased that the Hungarian Parliament has recently approved amendments to its controversial media law to address points proposed by the European Union, and in doing so, took the wind from the sails of those ideologists inciting tensions.<EOL>
What is most important, however, is that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has managed to deal with the Commission proposal swiftly.<EOL>
Your medical health fund would know that you are homosexual and your employer would know all about your previous and expected future illnesses and your forefathers.<EOL>
They impact on rural regions and the immediate periphery.<EOL>
Any non-citizen can acquire full rights, including the right to vote, by becoming a citizen.<EOL>
That is not the spirit of the treaty.<EOL>
Now it is also time to ensure that we can finalise this process and implement it in reality so that we have a good basis, not only for 2010 but for the further future, for being the best knowledge economy in the world.<EOL>
In my view, the Conference of Presidents rightly considers that this House should express a political view on that matter at an early date.<EOL>
I have a couple of comments, however.<EOL>
There is a broad consensus in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that financial services must form an integral part of this regulation in order to make it truly horizontal, that it should be coordinated with sectoral legislation at EU and national level so that there are no gaps, and that specialist advice should be sought.<EOL>
Finally, there is the issue of cooperation, and not just industrial cooperation: the Member States must also make an effort to harmonize the various requirements which apply to products and semi-finished goods.<EOL>
Likewise, sanctions often have limited impact on deterring and rehabilitating nations which break international law and violate human rights.<EOL>
The most important thing is to arrive at a resolution this week, and the second most important thing is to leave it in the hands of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.<EOL>
There is plenty of documentation, but that documentation is not always read.<EOL>
For many small European tax-payers, however, whose lives are being made intolerable by economy measures, the question is bound to arise as to whether they are even a step in the right direction.<EOL>
To conclude, here is a short quote, which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem.<EOL>
None of this is enough especially, Commissioner, as everyone will be able to access this sort of programme on the Internet sooner or later.<EOL>
Given the high volume of trade across the borders of the European Union, the enforcement of EU export controls on dual-use goods must rely on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures.<EOL>
Of course they need to know the facts of life but, at the same time, they need to know the most important fact of life: that they are extremely valuable, developing individuals, persons with a dignity and a future, with a unique contribution to make to their community and family.<EOL>
In practice, if we accept these arrangements, it would mean that, through the prior consultation procedure, the French government could request to be systematically informed if Spain were to issue a long-stay visa to an Algerian national tomorrow, and it would have the right to object to the request, without anyone' s knowledge, because currently no one knows which countries make use of the prior consultation procedure and the Council refuses to release the list of countries.<EOL>
In today's consumer society and with family relationships under threat, there are considerably more tragic cases.<EOL>
The Council particularly emphasised the need to pay special attention to the proportionality of the proposed measure in terms of its cost, whether it adequately safeguards privacy, especially as regards personal data protection, and its effectiveness.<EOL>
There is not much support for this proposal in such circles, and I should like to have heard you say something to refute what I have just suggested.<EOL>
If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation.<EOL>
The European Council which met on 22 and 23 March 2005, and of which I have already spoken in connection with relaunching the Lisbon strategy, has already adopted some key elements which will be essential for designing the future climate regime.<EOL>
Nor should we forget that the environment is an issue which attracts constant support from European citizens.<EOL>
Now how you make multilateral efforts without world leaders coming together as they will in Genoa later this month beats me!<EOL>
I will also speak to Mr Zapatero in person about this, because he leads the rotating Presidency.<EOL>
A week ago, we mentioned the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but today we must also acknowledge that not only do many countries fail to honour human rights, they blatantly violate them.<EOL>
We will not do so if we undermine personal rights.<EOL>
The fact is that this is not just about Mr Buttiglione, but now also about Mr Barroso himself.<EOL>
What we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader Community, no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens.<EOL>
Once again, and in the spirit of my earlier comments, I would like to say that the battle against protectionism cannot be won outright, but only by maintaining the necessary level of global alert on a daily basis.<EOL>
However, this cannot be established automatically vis-à-vis nationals of non-EU states as claimed in the report.<EOL>
I think that also applies to EU-Israel relations, but how can we get their attention to express the level of revulsion felt here at the scale of what is happening?<EOL>
We know that certain Member States sought such a restriction, whereas others did not want there to be any rules at all.<EOL>
This argument presupposes that, if there is an alternative location outside the EU with similar characteristics, the aid will tip the balance.<EOL>
It is a great mistake and an act of great populism, prejudice and dishonesty to see the concentration of media power owned by Silvio Berlusconi as giving him such a powerful, vice-like hold over the world of information and democracy itself in Italy.<EOL>
However, promise me that one of the major messages in that declaration next year will be that this European Union is not a competition amongst states, because that is what people increasingly fear.<EOL>
Obviously these questions are extremely important.<EOL>
Of course I regret this.<EOL>
We see right across Europe that 60% of public funds are used at regional level.<EOL>
The only thing I want to say to the Commissioner is, could he please tell us which advice he is taking?<EOL>
The criteria are too general, there is no cohesive policy and the use of interest margins is unclear.<EOL>
Written statements (Rule 149)<EOL>
Mr President, as our colleague, Mr Seppänen, said, our group is no supporter of the trade in emissions allowances, because we believe it may contribute to the imbalance between rich and poor countries, but we Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do support Mr Moreira da Silva's proposal, because it tries to establish stricter controls on this trade, restoring some of the amendments from first reading, which we believe to be important.<EOL>
Furthermore, we need to adapt competition policy, particularly national regional aid, and tax policy in order to strengthen regional and cohesion policy, with the understanding that the Structural Funds are not sufficient to counterbalance the handicaps and the delays in development accumulated over several decades.<EOL>
I would like to ask what objectives actually exist.<EOL>
That is the best light that we can shine in the dark corners of the European continent today.<EOL>
The people of Scotland deserve a clear answer to a clear question.<EOL>
When I bought my first car my primary consideration was to be noticed in it by the opposite sex.<EOL>
They should get properly reviewed scientific information at first hand with their medicines.<EOL>
Add to these the enlargement of the eurozone and the welcoming of Bulgaria and Romania, and 2007 could be a seminal year for Europe, particularly if we get the constitutional process back on track.<EOL>
I would like to say that we would rather look to the present and the future than back to the past.<EOL>
The current text includes exactly what the freight sector needs: traffic coordination, investments, management, standard rules in the event of disruption, easy access to the free market for applicants.<EOL>
To take advantage of those health-care services is a positive step in the right direction.<EOL>
In other words, centralised control is crucial.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estevez, I thank you for your report on the new protocol under the fisheries agreement with Madagascar, by which we can safeguard the operation of our tuna fleet in these waters up to and including May 2004.<EOL>
On top of that, they also present the threat of a new economic protectionism.<EOL>
Looking back to five years ago, 2004 turned out to be the golden year of reforms that brought Turkey really closer to the EU.<EOL>
We should be aware of this when we come to discuss Japan.<EOL>
Familiar though I am with the hospitals’ financial worries, they must do what has been done in other sectors and find intelligent ways of reducing costs, improving the coordination of their staff’s callouts and making better use of technical facilities.<EOL>
Coal gasification and coal liquefaction have similar benefits.<EOL>
In her Amendments Nos 1 and 6 she rejects the word "broadly" and says that the Member States must actually agree to remain "exactly" within the emission ceilings.<EOL>
There is clearly no sustainability here if we have to ask every President to grant us our parliamentary right and allow us to speak.<EOL>
Surely it cannot be acceptable for the European Union to supplement the development cooperation of the Member States with activities not supported by the Member States themselves because they do not consider them responsible.<EOL>
Finally, with regard to the need to work actively to achieve the proposed consistency between the raised European standards and existing international standards, a problem which this report mentions almost as an aside, I also regret the fact that Parliament has not really discussed this vital point in any more detail so as to ensure that our initiatives do not have the effect of penalising European producers.<EOL>
Some will naively argue that this is a coincidence, but I would like to point out that more objective observers will note the proximity of the European elections.<EOL>
Finally, I would like to stress Parliament's message to the Council to respond in a substantive manner, especially to Parliament's urgency resolutions.<EOL>
The EU's position on world markets will, in future, be greatly influenced by the success of innovations and the speed of innovation cycles.<EOL>
I imagine you are referring to Rule 145.<EOL>
I hope, however, that he will not use these great complimentary speeches by the whole House to his benefit in the election campaign, as we are in different camps.<EOL>
I fully appreciate that a multilateral treaty of this kind cannot impose too many dictates, but an awful lot is left to the goodwill of the Member States.<EOL>
Parliament has obtained quite significant concessions from the Council of Ministers in a range of important areas, such as comitology, mandatory standards for 2005 covering the main parameters, bringing forward the requirement for on-board diagnostic systems in diesel and light commercial vehicles, the early and gradual phasing-in of cleaner fuels and many other things.<EOL>
While we must support the commitments made by the European Union to those countries, it is also necessary to find a solution for many countries of Europe.<EOL>
I would like to reiterate that here at this point: because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern Germany and northern Italy are more modern than the ones the Republic of Austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system.<EOL>
Member States do not, however, have the power to take independent decisions on veterinary matters relating to imports of products from third countries.<EOL>
As matters stand, we owe it to our own credibility to take this decision.<EOL>
As we state in the report, what we expect from the Commission is, inter alia, the following:<EOL>
The entire internal market is involved in the codecision process.<EOL>
Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today.<EOL>
The written and audiovisual media are in a position of power in being able to report on various matters.<EOL>
The end result of this will be a burgeoning of the EU’s bureaucratic machinery, even though the latter already lacks transparency and merely places an undue burden on taxpayers in the Member States.<EOL>
In October a group of young Italians outraged the memory of the Holocaust, shouting in favour of Hitler in the Dachau concentration camp.<EOL>
Parliament will, as is rightly called for in the resolution, be closely informed - that also is a point that was raised tonight - about our monitoring and compliance-assessment work.<EOL>
The whole thing could happen as early as next week.<EOL>
The principle of subsidiarity must be considered to a high degree in this context, as must the financial framework.<EOL>
A need for incentives to actively seek employment cannot be overlooked.<EOL>
This is also one of the areas which we advocated in our Green Paper on the European Research Area.<EOL>
Some of the Members who referred to the Vaxholm case have left now.<EOL>
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, small-scale enterprises are central to my region.<EOL>
While thousands of pages of printed paper and huge libraries and archives used to be needed for the storage of information, now the same quantity of information is stored on Internet websites and computer discs.<EOL>
I will speak of enlargement, which is a matter, as you rightly said, Mr President of the Council, for the whole future of Europe.<EOL>
Someone has to pay.<EOL>
Furthermore, we need constantly to review our policies and management of systems to ensure that there is no scope for fraud, and I regret that we have not made the further progress we hoped for on the activity-based budgeting that the Commission adopted.<EOL>
The main problem of the directive is its enforcement.<EOL>
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.<EOL>
In this respect in particular, the European Parliament will have a key role to play, with the engagement and the opportunities Parliament has with Congress in relations with members of Congress.<EOL>
I would like to thank the Commissioner for the plans that she has announced.<EOL>
The peer review during the third stage, which is the main part of the test, involves a team with seven external members.<EOL>
   – Mr President, the war in Darfur, in the western part of the Sudan, has lasted since 2003, a devastating civil war that has resulted in the appalling toll of 200 000 dead and 3 million refugees, which observers describe as ‘Rwanda in slow motion’.<EOL>
A final word, this time, after so many negatives, to recommend the adoption of Amendment No 199, tabled by Mr Borghezio and myself, on the compensation due to Italian military detainees for the forced labour they did in Germany between 1943 and 1945.<EOL>
(ET) We remain here this evening - actually it is already night - to discuss the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.<EOL>
The European Union must act to ensure that there are no safe havens in Europe for cyber paedophiles.<EOL>
The basic position here is that institutional reform will not succeed without also taking the share of the small countries into consideration when the number of votes is being weighted<EOL>
Adjournment of the session<EOL>
Mr President, the Commission's attention was given to the use of depleted uranium in armour-piercing shells as long ago as 1993.<EOL>
The adoption of a common and uniform legal status for all European political parties and the foundations that are associated with them, founded directly on EU law, represents a very important first step in this direction.<EOL>
This is the first specific indicator which will reflect developments in this sector over a ten-year period.<EOL>
This means that we will actually have a much safer internal market.<EOL>
(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs for the results they achieved in negotiating the 2010 budget.<EOL>
And we are all obliged to make this effort: the European institutions, specifically the Commission, but also the Member States and the beneficiary regions.<EOL>
This cross-cutting issue must be discussed multilaterally as it affects people worldwide and the multiplying effects are indisputable.<EOL>
It is then, probably towards the end or the middle of 2004, that we shall know exactly what we are prepared to offer and I shall make these offers, as I have done so far, in cooperation with the Council, with Parliament and with a number of other professional and other sectors of civil society that are concerned by these matters.<EOL>
It is absolutely clear that the ruling political class, the President included, is capable of anything in order to reinforce its power, and, and in so doing, does not even balk at taking the path of ethnic cleansing.<EOL>
The European Commission's Directorate-General for regional policy issued an invitation to tender for the programme at the end of July.<EOL>
On the other hand I would like to say that it is not always the political input that provides a solution.<EOL>
   – Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Krehl not only for her report but also for the hard work she has put into drawing up the European Parliament’s position.<EOL>
I would mention the need for full respect by Turkey of human, minority and religious rights and full implementation of the Copenhagen criteria.<EOL>
This hope must not be a pretext for a falsely naive discussion.<EOL>
The President replied that the vote was confirmed<EOL>
You have indeed been forced yet again to repeat what you have said to Turkey on numerous occasions, as you yourself remarked, about the stand it must maintain as a candidate member of the European Union.<EOL>
It is true that DG Sanco’s informal consultation did not mention the classification of ETS as a carcinogen, firstly because it had a preliminary and informal character and it tried to get the opinion of selected players.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the honourable Member alludes to the application of the general safeguard clause in Article 37 of the Act of Accession.<EOL>
I would like to remind you that in the strategic guidelines we asked Member States to pay particular attention to territorial issues when preparing their national development plans.<EOL>
The countries in South Caucasus have certain features which are necessary to the success of European projects in key areas such as energy and transport.<EOL>
It was composed of named people.<EOL>
I would also stress the extension of assistance to medium-sized companies for marketing and processing, as well as any form of producers association.<EOL>
   Those who vote against paragraph 4 (EUR 50 million for purchase of the buildings in Strasbourg and EUR 25 million for propaganda) are not affecting the budget, but are merely trying to conceal waste from the electorate.<EOL>
Part of this amount, EUR 6.5 million, will be payable by the participants: the three institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - and the governments and parliaments of the Member States or the candidate countries.<EOL>
What is worse is that the instruments the Commission had - the NER300, the Recovery Plan and certain funds available today at the European Investment Bank - are more prioritised for those so-called low-carbon technologies that are the least efficient and present the highest risk.<EOL>
Thus, if we were to add the 25 years to the 70 years, we would end up preventing the modification of a common product which often - and also, so to speak, by its very nature and taking into account novelty and creativity - cannot last very long, not beyond the lifetime of a human being, for example, and therefore a ceiling of 25 years would seem reasonable.<EOL>
A few weeks ago Boeing publically rejected the latest olive branch, if I can call it that, proffered by Airbus.<EOL>
With all these fine measures that are now being proposed, I have one overriding question, and I believe that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already mentioned it as well.<EOL>
I hear again and again from the trade unions that, in the area of wage settlement, the autonomy of the Member States and their social partners is being harmed and that we are possibly heading for a flagrant violation of the regulation of competencies under the Treaty.<EOL>
This would jeopardise the trust between institutions and would strip Parliament of its capacity to have a say in the drawing up of the Union’s budgetary policies.<EOL>
My second criticism follows on from the first.<EOL>
I wanted to put an end to European Councils publishing 50-page communiqués that nobody reads, and I therefore proposed an eight-page communiqué.<EOL>
It is imperative that these funds are made available to those who really need them in an expedient and effective manner.<EOL>
There are two other issues which are important for the future. I will only mention them in passing, given the lack of time to go into any depth.<EOL>
Under the terms of the Tampere conclusions, environmental crime is one of the areas specifically mentioned, on which efforts must be concentrated in order to establish common definitions, charges and sanctions between the various national criminal laws.<EOL>
   Madam President, I would also like to offer the rapporteurs my heartfelt thanks and with regard to social policy I would say that a number of problems do still remain.<EOL>
Although the rapporteur's proposals were accepted as such by the Council, the entire quality beef industry which control its supplies under a strict set of specifications, would be penalised.<EOL>
Perhaps you could just state that the Statement of Assurance is absent or that you do not believe that reforms will be in place by the time promised, or perhaps you could just report that, where agriculture is concerned there has been no preparation for enlargement to speak of.<EOL>
The Commission is doing what it is required to do, and I also believe that the negotiations themselves are going very well.<EOL>
Despite all that, at the end of the day, this money, which is supposed to assist the local people, will, even so, be better employed over there than the money given to major employers over here who are shedding jobs.<EOL>
- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, we were told very graphically as children how General Tito tore through the streets of Belgrade, people jumping aside - it was closed, no traffic regulations were in force.<EOL>
This vote confirms a favourable change in how agriculture is taken into account in Community policies.<EOL>
We must not forget the pioneering role of Slovenia which to a significant extent started the pro-European process in the Balkans.<EOL>
But that is far from being a perfect solution.<EOL>
I hope the House will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report.<EOL>
This report may well be a key factor in the development of the European economy and genuine free competition.<EOL>
We will focus on concrete proposals to change the different relevant legal instruments.<EOL>
There should be clear scientific evidence on the table so that the Member States can maintain stricter rules.<EOL>
However, failure to remind will certainly be understood by the Russian authorities as indulgence.<EOL>
Commissioner, a promise of more in 2007 is simply that: a promise.<EOL>
Thank you, Mr President.<EOL>
It is nothing less than the world's most significant energy legislation that we are to adopt here in the European Parliament tomorrow.<EOL>
I think it wise of Mr Duff to propose a formula that simply talks about reconciling historical differences.<EOL>
We regret that the joint resolution did not take up our suggestion to make the new reconstruction programmes conditional upon an undertaking by the governments of the former Yugoslavia to cooperate actively in the fight against organised crime.<EOL>
The process lacked concept, planning and project management.<EOL>
The occasion for today’s debate is, as is invariable in the case of matters of topical and urgent importance, an escalation of violence.<EOL>
We have to know what surgeons are carrying them out.<EOL>
I am talking about NATO.<EOL>
I have nothing further to add.<EOL>
I thank the rapporteur for drafting a report which generally strikes that balance.<EOL>
<EOL>
The debate now is in the Council, I would say.<EOL>
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.<EOL>
The proposal is in line with the new Animal Health strategy for the European Union (2007-2013) 'Prevention is better than cure', as it involves both a more flexible approach to vaccination and an improvement in the current measures for combating the principal diseases in animals.<EOL>
How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC?<EOL>
It has already started and it is sure to continue.<EOL>
Today the record of the European Union is quite clear.<EOL>
I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important issue.<EOL>
You must bear in mind that the Enlargement Directorate-General's activity next year will not be confined to the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, but that it will continue to administer pre-accession aid; also, a specific programme was agreed for 2004 and subsequent years in the accession negotiations to continue to give administrative assistance for the development of a good administration.<EOL>
We now see women working in design offices, on computers, or on the new production lines for electronic equipment, mobile telephones and televisions.<EOL>
<EOL>
That is how the Council comes across to the public.<EOL>
Until such time as that fund is put in place, the fishing businesses affected must be granted some form of temporary compensation.<EOL>
The realignment of the strategy towards growth and employment within a context of sustainable development won broad support.<EOL>
The question arises as to whether the accounts and administration have been attended to in the same way a careful man would attend to his own finances.<EOL>
Its main aim was to identify the principle challenges to be overcome by all the health care systems in all the Member States, and to propose joint objectives that could be used as guidelines by the Member States when developing or, potentially, reforming these systems.<EOL>
But seriously.<EOL>
However, you will no doubt be aware that the European Union, whilst fully supportive of the efforts undertaken to eradicate terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, is taking an active part in the humanitarian operation designed to assist the displaced people in the region.<EOL>
For this reason, failure is not an option.<EOL>
Now I wish to add three demands to the list already presented. Firstly, we must demand that the commanders of the army, who are known to have taken part in this outrage, withdraw immediately.<EOL>
Let me cite another instance.<EOL>
Let me first of all remind Members of Parliament of the fact that we are the biggest provider of humanitarian aid in the DRC this year - EUR 35 million in ECHO funded activities and some EUR 10 million from other sources.<EOL>
Thousands of people die each year in attempting to reach Europe in ways that are unsafe.<EOL>
Mr President, it is clear that in our European Union today changes are underway, particularly in the Commission, as a result of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget and then the consequent and ultimate mass resignation of the Commission.<EOL>
The system exists and it is at the disposal of the Member States, but it is not the Commission' s responsibility.<EOL>
Consequently, the common position of Council was adopted by unanimity and endorsed by the Commission.<EOL>
But the opportunity that now exists really must be used to the full.<EOL>
The June List, which I represent, has consistently emphasised that it is reprehensible to refer to the EU Constitution, given that the populations in two of the EU Member States have clearly and unambiguously rejected it in referendums.<EOL>
This is all about allowing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to capital.<EOL>
I do not think this is the path to be taking; quite the reverse.<EOL>
All the Latin American governments have also set themselves the aim of achieving general economic stability through reforms, and the majority of these governments have carried out some radical reforms, based on sound financial management and economic openness.<EOL>
In response to some of the speeches, it seems to me that we have nevertheless put the issue of services of general interest on the European agenda.<EOL>
Tomorrow, the plenary session can simply end the conflict by accepting the compromise that was reached with the Council.<EOL>
As such, it is a good opportunity for us to improve the already existing agreement.<EOL>
However, a tenth of the Hungarians remained in Austria, a country to which Hungarians had always felt close.<EOL>
Mr President, I consider Commissioner Oreja's reply to be very unsatisfactory.<EOL>
It was in fact the case that all the candidates could put forward their programme freely and without restraint and that the political debate in Algeria took place in the kind of constructive atmosphere not seen for a long time.<EOL>
, in writing. - I have several remarks on sometimes misleading wording, which has largely been used here also. 'The Irish people's will', 'Irish cause' or 'Irish no', 'the decision of Ireland, killer of Lisbon': all that and similar vocabulary should be put aside.<EOL>
Mr Bütikofer listed four priorities for the next year which I largely support.<EOL>
We must therefore make sure that the decision to apply Article 9 a is unassailable before the European Court of Justice and for this reason the rapporteurs will be proposing a revised draft to Parliament taking into account the European Council's wishes.<EOL>
The solving of environmental issues in those countries is very high on the list of priorities.<EOL>
Firstly, checks in the Member States are very permeable, with most Member States taking lightly or disregarding their monitoring obligation.<EOL>
We do not do this because we know it works but because it is necessary.<EOL>
It is true that heavy goods vehicles are involved in only 6% of accidents, but 16% of these accidents are fatal.<EOL>
This is a humanitarian issue, so it concerns you too.<EOL>
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Bontempi on his excellent report and I should like to emphasize that I have had a very good working relationship with him and the Committee on Civil Liberties for many years in matters concerning the legal protection of citizens.<EOL>
We want people at national and local level to sit on the board.<EOL>
The compromise directive which we are discussing right now does not give any guarantee in this sense.<EOL>
Economic interests have brought China closer to countries with problems such as Iran, Sudan or Venezuela.<EOL>
   The debate is closed.<EOL>
The Commission can accept the eight amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, either in full or in principle.<EOL>
Next, Parliament's great contribution - which also led to a disagreement with the Council - is that we believe that crew members who carry out safety duties must be taken into account in a subsequent text, and we propose a road map.<EOL>
The interrelationship between human and animal cloning is evident and as the previously insurmountable barriers between the species become invisible, we need to have the courage to call a halt to cloning all animals, not just human ones.<EOL>
It is not the intention of the Commission to do anything in secret generally and more specifically, in this area.<EOL>
One thing is clear, and that is that the Cardiff Summit was a Summit without any news.<EOL>
This must not happen: this instrument is supposed to be independent of host-country control.<EOL>
There are countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, in which this proportion is as high as 40%, while almost two-thirds of the people who buy their holidays in this way do not realise that their interests are protected to a significantly lower degree than in the case of people who still buy holidays in the traditional way.<EOL>
This is not, however, a slip of the tongue.<EOL>
I wish you continuing success.<EOL>
However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank.<EOL>
The effect of doing so would be to leave such products unregulated in many parts of Europe as regards their safety, quality and efficacy.<EOL>
   . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the scale of the disaster in Asia leads us to reflect on the fragility of human life in the face of the force of nature and on how other matters pale in comparison with a human tragedy on this scale.<EOL>
Gothenburg European Council<EOL>
ECHO is an organisation with its own power to act and with motivated staff who are ready to implement the proposed improvements.<EOL>
Thirdly, it is crucial that the Commission should pursue and develop a more active policy in the realm of non-food crops, because we have simply ground to a halt somewhere along the line.<EOL>
I would be able to address you in five of the European languages, but I will not do that because I will get confused myself, so I will stick to two: English and Portuguese.<EOL>
I am not doing it today because the Association of European Journalists has asked that we detail the votes.<EOL>
This should involve abandoning maximum rates and introducing only minimum rates.<EOL>
I wish you every ounce of conviction and determination on this issue, but I will watch with interest to see the outcome.<EOL>
I would like to conclude by asking the Commissioner whether he can tell us in his reply what value the Commission will place on the report but also on Parliament's opinion so as to enlighten subsequent choices.<EOL>
With regard to financial support for Belarus, a number of obstacles should be removed.<EOL>
A strong and properly financed EU regional policy is the basis for ensuring social, economic and territorial cohesion.<EOL>
   – Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, this debate reminds me a little of the debate we held on so-called services of general interest and competition law.<EOL>
The proposal also provides that, in future, service providers will no longer have to furnish comprehensive information.<EOL>
Furthermore, we need to ensure that consumers have enough confidence in the regulatory framework so that they do not refrain from purchasing timeshare abroad from legitimate traders.<EOL>
We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that.<EOL>
Strategies came and went, and the economy collapsed.<EOL>
We should avoid duplication.<EOL>
I think it is important to inform you that the French Presidency correctly notified its apologies in advance of the beginning of the debate and informed us that Mrs Dati was unable to participate in the debate because she was detained for unavoidable reasons and that Mr Jouyet, who was replacing her, was not able to stay.<EOL>
In committee we have introduced an amendment to the regulation on control measures, so that the Commission may present us with an annual report on the control and monitoring measures carried out within the scope of the RFOs in which the European Union participates.<EOL>
The international community, if it fails in the transition - if we fail - will be covered with shame.<EOL>
Mr President, the subject of future relations between the European Union and the ACP countries is an essential part of the Union's future external relations and a fundamental part of cooperation policies aimed at development.<EOL>
It contains important objectives.<EOL>
The period of integration is both a psychological factor and an economic one.<EOL>
I will oppose any support by the EU and its Member States for poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for at least four reasons: insufficient infrastructure, absence of economic competitiveness, huge expansion in the wrong direction and, finally, there is no lack of opiates on the world markets at present.<EOL>
The constitutional Council in France, the constitutional Court in Italy, the constitutional Court in Germany and the European Court of Justice in the Kalanke judgement, have condemned the measures which systematically favour, in an equal situation, the recruitment of women in the name of the famous principle of equality.<EOL>
We are also following the events in the rest of the region closely.<EOL>
Good regulation is not enough to ensure future economic growth in the European Union.<EOL>
Yet another European Council summit is to deal with the Lisbon Strategy, which is deemed to have failed and needs to be reviewed.<EOL>
Mr President, I am not going to repeat what I and others who have contributed to the debate have already said.<EOL>
I should like to highlight the expectations of young people.<EOL>
rapporteur. - (RO) I believe that we are now at a time when we must do as much as we can to keep alive commercial companies in Europe and, in particular, find those incentives to make successful businesses capable of providing as many jobs as possible.<EOL>
They are completely unsupported.<EOL>
The European Union needs to take measures to familiarise modern America and its citizens with the achievements of European integration in recent years.<EOL>
The Council will deal with it in a horizontal manner.<EOL>
We realised the importance of protecting the victims and raising the awareness of society.<EOL>
This would not have been possible without constructive cooperation on everyone's part and if the European Union had not been able to imprint such a clear hallmark on the agreement reached in Cancún.<EOL>
Thank you, Minister.<EOL>
The poultry sector will have less reason to take preventative measures if it is given promises of compensation in advance.<EOL>
A number of the wishes you have expressed, which I have listened to very carefully this afternoon, will be incorporated in the Action Plan for Logistics that will be coming out by the end of October.<EOL>
But the result of that will be a lot of labelling, a lengthy process and a great deal of concealment.<EOL>
It will not be easy to do so, but it does appear to be possible.<EOL>
The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that, by 2050, the world population will increase from the current 6 billion to 9 billion, and that doubling the demand for food will require an associated increase in global food production.<EOL>
Unfortunately, the situation there has not improved and the prolonged destructive civil war has carried on unabated.<EOL>
(The President asked the speaker to conclude)<EOL>
That will definitely not, though, put a stop to his commitment.<EOL>
We hope that the House will support them and that such issues will be given much fuller consideration in the debate on the recent Commission communication on fisheries agreements with third countries.<EOL>
This is something that we are going to see happening again if we do not look at our whole policy - this fortress Europe mentality - the fact that we are building the barricades and the walls higher and higher.<EOL>
It is of vital importance to develop an ecosystem approach for adaptation to climate change, in particular in relation to policies which affect land, water and marine use.<EOL>
For the time being it may look too much like a catalogue of worthy aims, but the Commission wants to reshape it and transform it into a road map for prosperity, identifying clear objectives and a demanding calendar.<EOL>
I believe that these are two very tangible issues on the basis of which Turkey's credibility can be judged.<EOL>
The new approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation provides for the free movement of goods and a high level of health, consumer and environmental protection.<EOL>
The Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights.<EOL>
A crumb of recognition for public opinion falls from the master's table in the form of Amendments 10, 12, 39 and 42, to place reducing animal experimentation in certain circumstances before adherence to the letter of the legislation.<EOL>
Speak to your group chairman, who will give it to you.<EOL>
Members are obviously very concerned at the human rights aspects of the progress of the war on terror.<EOL>
The Kurdish issue, including its cultural and economic aspects, must likewise be addressed.<EOL>
Romania supports the 20-20-20 target on cutting carbon emissions by 20%, increasing the proportion of energy obtained from renewable resources by 20% and boosting energy efficiency by 20%.<EOL>
The European Union must come to give a different answer to that which it has given hitherto to the developing countries’ calls for the implementation of ‘Mode 4’.<EOL>
As regards the 14 projects, the European Parliament' s call for a cost-benefit analysis was not heeded, whilst its call for environmental compatibility checks for all the projects was also ignored; only partial checks were carried out, which conflicts with the relevant directive.<EOL>
I will conclude, Mr President, Minister, with a suggestion for future generations.<EOL>
Among other aspects:<EOL>
The Commission can accept the following amendments subject to rewording: 2, 3, 9, 11, 14, 18, 20, 26, 29, 34, 35, 37, 38, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 66, 73, 79, 81, 87, 91, 92, 101, 105, 107, 108, 109, 118, 121, 140, 144, 146, 148, 150, 151, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 176, 179, 180, 184, 185, 186, 187, 192, 194, 197, 198 and 205.<EOL>
I supported this resolution in order to highlight the major commitment to solidarity that the European Union needs to deploy in order to come to the aid of this country, which was devastated nearly a month ago.<EOL>
I would also echo the concern of the rapporteur on the issue of comitology.<EOL>
For us social democrats, a consistently high level of safety was the top priority objective.<EOL>
This will include the analysis of the capacity of an enlarged Europe to function properly.<EOL>
I see this test as a means of giving a very strong impetus to the necessary reforms.<EOL>
Having said this, where should we act and at what level?<EOL>
His lonely protest had no rationale behind it, but imagine if everyone had acted with the same courage.<EOL>
That is what drives those passengers to use aircraft and cars, while the Commission’s White Paper on transport took for granted that there would be more medium-distance transport of passengers by rail by 2010.<EOL>
Our contributions, which tomorrow will be taken on board by the entire Parliament, define and improve the Commission's proposals.<EOL>
The possibility of financing such measures from the resources of current agricultural guidelines will cause tremendous problems. It will also transfer a large part of the cost of enlargement onto the shoulders of the less developed regions of the European Union.<EOL>
In particular, has the Council received full information on the transposition into UK law of the 2003 Framework Decision, and why does it think there have been no UK prosecutions of foreign bribery?<EOL>
The use of the relevant directives to enforce the freedom to provide services is always justified by reference to - among others - the argument that, at the end of the day, there has to be something in it for the consumer.<EOL>
The goal should be to devise a system of global financial governance adapted to the challenges of the 21st century in terms of efficiency, transparency and representation.<EOL>
One of our concerns is institutional transparency.<EOL>
This money is intended to support the economic stabilisation of that country, finance its external balance-of-payments needs and help it meet the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis.<EOL>
I believe, exactly like Mrs de Palacio, that we need all the resources we can obtain.<EOL>
They serve no purpose whatsoever at this juncture, as they were originally designed to target a regime which now no longer exists.<EOL>
For the EIT to bloom, all the climatic conditions have to be right.<EOL>
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too must thank the rapporteur for drawing up such a good report.<EOL>
We believe that the EU will have to be quite forceful in fostering this approach.<EOL>
While I was there, an elderly Turkish pensioner who had recognised me approached me and, while we visited the ruins of Troy together, he asked: "But why is it that, when the Morillon directive was debated, the amendments requesting Turkey not to build nuclear power stations or, at least, to ensure that its nuclear power stations do not cause pollution, to resolve the Kurd issue and to abolish the death penalty were not adopted?<EOL>
This only applies - as I understand - to animals excreting pathogens ingested with contaminated feed, not, as some newspapers inferred, from animals incubating or suffering from this disease.<EOL>
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer: this confirms Parliament's desire, therefore, to see a degree of coherence in this matter.<EOL>
I also agree with the call for the Commission to table any legislative measures that might prove necessary to strengthen financial stability and sustainable economic growth.<EOL>
Ensuring the safety of nuclear installations and preventing the risk of accidents in every way possible are important issues addressed in this resolution, which also calls on the Member States to impose 'a moratorium on the development and commissioning of new nuclear reactors, at least for the period during which the stress tests are conducted and evaluated'.<EOL>
There is no point at all in insisting that all procurement contracts are put out to tender if the procedure is insufficiently transparent, small and medium-sized businesses do not bid, and these thresholds are ultimately devoid of impact on the competitive structure in Europe.<EOL>
Where large parts of the present Treaty are concerned, the Group wants it to be possible for changes to be made without these being approved by the Member States' parliaments and without any requirement of unanimity.<EOL>
In this connection, what view does it take of the visit by the King of Morocco to Western Sahara, which was strongly criticised by the Polisario Front?<EOL>
The gas pipeline must not jeopardise the EU internal market.<EOL>
Furthermore, the Finnish Presidency adopted a resolution on 21 June 1999, in which the EU' s promise of support for the UN peace plan and related action was reiterated.<EOL>
It is not right for full employment to be de facto abandoned as a political objective and for everything, literally everything, to be subordinated to monetary stability.<EOL>
The Swedish Presidency will, with great resolve, continue the efforts of the previous presidencies to encourage improvement in democracy in Belarus.<EOL>
We are talking - as has been emphasised - about a voluntary market instrument aimed at improving the contribution which businesses make to the environment.<EOL>
We have to respect the advice of our legal service - advice also echoed by the legal service of the Council.<EOL>
However, the lack of a commitment to minimum legal safeguards is the deciding factor in my voting "no" .<EOL>
She really can feel that way today.<EOL>
You will know that the trafficking of human beings is now one of the major sources of income for totally unscrupulous organised crime.<EOL>
For example, the Commissioners from Scandinavia, Mr Nielson and Ms Wallström, came out well from the hearings.<EOL>
It is clear, then, that we have to do something about this.<EOL>
I am happy to grant Mrs Záborská this request.<EOL>
I think 30 minutes is ridiculous.<EOL>
The European Parliament, the societies of the Member States of the European Union, will not show indefinite patience if the situation does not appear to be improving.<EOL>
Colonel Gaddafi is a dictator who has been in power for 41 years, and who said just a few days ago that he regrets the departure of his Tunisian counterpart, Mr Ben Ali.<EOL>
Despite the self-inflicted interruption in supplies, we must not allow our agricultural industry to be contaminated with GMOs.<EOL>
Everywhere, there are still shocking deficiencies: in safety and air traffic control, on the railways, in the maritime sector, and in road transport.<EOL>
The word "bio' is a favourable word and the word "techno' reminds us of a sort of natural music which would be modified.<EOL>
Their presence reminds us that, in May of last year, the fifth enlargement of the European Union was left incomplete while we waited for Romania and Bulgaria to complete their accession processes.<EOL>
I am glad more speakers from non-Mediterranean countries have taken the floor.<EOL>
The Iranian regime asserted that respect for human rights is guaranteed there.<EOL>
I do not see why some of you are so concerned with the nationality of the purchasers of the assets of the yards.<EOL>
We and the Irish Government have concerns regarding references to a strong linking of HIV/AIDS prevention and sexual and reproductive rights in policies, programmes, strategies and public education.<EOL>
However, many of us would receive a large pay rise, which would be totally unjustified.<EOL>
Each of the Member States is different. Each has its own economic structure.<EOL>
For instance, in the Data Retention Directive, we left it to Member States to decide if they would compensate telecoms companies.<EOL>
Firstly, it is because these committees of national civil servants - and only these committees - have the right to block the Commission implementing measure and refer it back to the legislature or part of the legislature.<EOL>
This work will be difficult, but the crisis is a learning opportunity we simply cannot miss.<EOL>
However, the timescale for the correction could take account of economic factors.<EOL>
What is the position regarding the problem of illegal immigrants who are smuggled into an EU Member State which does not have diplomatic relations of any kind with the countries of origin of the illegal immigrants, thereby leaving that State in a quandary over what to do with them?<EOL>
Even the honour of the European Union will be lost.<EOL>
This means that, if required, and if there is the political will, the multiannual financial framework leaves us some leeway within the agreed limits.<EOL>
There are also some serious questions relating to planning because some of the afforestation is also unsightly.<EOL>
What has it done?<EOL>
Mr President, we agree with Mrs Béguin's report because it is underpinned by a particular situation: neither the Convention on Biological Diversity, signed in 1992, nor the various international conventions incorporated into Community law, specifically the birds and habitats directives, have managed to put a brake on the destruction of biodiversity.<EOL>
It must be recalled that the Eastern Partnership started being implemented when the financial crisis was in full swing.<EOL>
This is reflected in the confirmation through the accession process, not least the Commission communication on which Mr Belder has reported, and I congratulate him, that respect for racial equality and minority rights falls within the Copenhagen criteria.<EOL>
European exports, as the report before us clearly demonstrates, have been the target on a number of occasions of such measures on the part of third countries.<EOL>
The fact is that we have agencies such as those on medicinal products and standardisation which are financed by means of contributions, and nobody would suggest that they have been infiltrated.<EOL>
However, when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
I wish to stress that this debate does not go against the Constitutional Treaty: we want to emphasise specifically the importance of the Treaty in the development of an area based on freedom, security and justice.<EOL>
To our very deep regret, that was not the case.<EOL>
What has happened in the world since 11 September?<EOL>
It has nothing to do with enhancing the security of our citizens.<EOL>
The social measures apply to self-employed fishermen as well as to employees.<EOL>
Figures were laid down for the internal policy areas as they were for the others, stating how much was allocated.<EOL>
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is a sobering one; following the political shock administered by the ‘no’ vote against the constitution, we now face the threat of economic paralysis, of Lisbon becoming, like the celebrated woman without the lower half of her body, an attraction in a freak show, for, despite the consensus that the strategy’s implementation is the responsibility of the Member States, it is these that we see committing protectionist fouls in the name of economic patriotism, and this is cause for considerable concern.<EOL>
There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment.<EOL>
I, too, am all in favour of protecting the environment and of making whatever financial provision is necessary for it, and I would be happy if we were able today to make generous financial arrangements for the protection of nature.<EOL>
Last year, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, the budget passed through the symbolic barrier of EUR 100 billion.<EOL>
This belief can do much to help harmonious human relations, and anyone who is violent to those around him is simply denying this biblical truth.<EOL>
Subject: Progress with reorganisation of Olympic Airways In October 1994, the Greek Government, in collaboration with the Commission, launched a programme to reorganise Olympic Airways.<EOL>
I will now close the debate, and remind you that the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .<EOL>
A number of concrete proposals have been tabled to turn the tide and call an end to this development.<EOL>
This is not only a moral choice, but also the best basis for a sustainable policy which will safeguard our cohesion and will inspire respect for and confidence in the Union in its citizens who, in all events, expect clear justification for the decisions of the European Council and a public dialogue which, unfortunately, has not yet taken place, with substance and depth on the future of euro-Turkish relations.<EOL>
Furthermore, High Representative Javier Solana and the personal representative of the EU Presidency ambassador, Mr Biegman, are also fully engaged in helping to solve the crisis.<EOL>
This result is mainly due to a high proportion of advance payments in 2008, which have a lower risk of error than interim and final payments.<EOL>
As I said before, more intensive engagement is needed from the EU and the international community.<EOL>
Secondly, there is the ECJ’s consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation.<EOL>
It is our responsibility to encourage the two parts of the island to cooperate.<EOL>
However, only when in Europe, agreements are more important than political opportunism will public confidence have a real chance of growing.<EOL>
Mr President, today’s vote is concerned with three of those seven legal bases.<EOL>
Allow me in conclusion to thank the rapporteurs.<EOL>
I can assure the honourable gentleman that the government to which he referred has been active in advancing the case to which he also referred and has an interest.<EOL>
Finally, I express my support for the emphasis in the conclusions on the transatlantic economic and political relationship and, in particular, Chancellor Merkel's personal commitment to a new transatlantic economic relationship.<EOL>
The European Union should therefore signal to these countries that their own efforts in the whole area of environmental protection are an essential condition for closer relations and, finally, accession to the European Union.<EOL>
With the majority of us in agreement, it is the best possible compromise at the present time because it strikes a balance between the interests of all those involved.<EOL>
As you have rightly said Commissioner, it is the job of politicians in Albania now to take their own fate into their hands at last and, if it is at all possible - and I address this both to the Council and the Commission - I would make a heartfelt request for pressure from both sides. I do not mean gentle pressure but really energetic pressure, so that they finally get together in reconciliation and in the interests of the tormented people of Albania.<EOL>
However, fortunately or unfortunately, the State of Kansas is not part of the European Union.<EOL>
Clearly we are not listening or delivering on our citizens’ priorities.<EOL>
The principle of geographical balance was the main cause of these debates, a principle that - along with the priorities of institutional and gender balance - was eventually included in the report in a much attenuated form.<EOL>
I believe that you have already received a series of particular items of information, but I shall shortly be sending you a summary document, which will give an overview.<EOL>
To give just three examples: the 'Globalisation Adjustment Fund' should not be used as a temporary cushion against the unacceptable social and economic costs of closure and relocation of undertakings, with the consequent destruction of jobs.<EOL>
We are committed to continuing to enhance transparency and openness.<EOL>
As Europe stands on the brink of a highly successful age, its citizens are vacillating.<EOL>
We consider the wording used in point 35 of the report to be excessive, particularly as far as tax reductions are concerned.<EOL>
I do, though, think Mrs Pack was right to say that we should start with the young and invest more in them.<EOL>
This new situation leads to two problems: increased costs arising from the need for more assistants, and additional space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions.<EOL>
Europe has to be able to clearly distinguish itself in the eyes of the Uzbek people, both from the reason of state of the Russian and Chinese Governments, and from the outright cynicism of Washington, which continues to pay out millions of dollars to Karimov in exchange for military bases.<EOL>
I can even go a step further and say that given that this is about media pluralism and given that media pluralism plays a significant role in promoting democracy in a country, the Commission is also taking this case particularly seriously.<EOL>
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.<EOL>
I want to emphasise that science - this is a truism - has intrinsic worth: it is not simply worthy in the utilitarian, productive and competitive sense, though these aspects are also important.<EOL>
One of the basic principles of competition policy is notification, in other words, an indication must be given of everything that is compulsorily notifiable, in the context of competition policy, both on the Bulgarian side and also on the side of the European Union.<EOL>
That is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror, which, every day, as Mr Belder and Mrs Schroedter said, pushes young Chechens to despair, young people who have seen their parents, brothers and cousins killed in Grozny or in other towns in Chechnya, kidnapped and raped by the Russian forces.<EOL>
An initial provision has been made for this in the 2002 budget, with EUR 130 million in addition to the funds already earmarked for humanitarian aid.<EOL>
Let us extend that dispensation beyond aviation.<EOL>
They have declared themselves ready to move into top gear and they have also taken major decisions paving the way for the actual implementation of our commitments under the new Lisbon Strategy.<EOL>
But at the same time it is the world's greatest donor: 60 % of development cooperation and 80 % of the aid flowing to the countries of the former Soviet Union come from the European Union.<EOL>
Finally, may I thank the rapporteur for his good work and remind you that avoidance is better than dealing with the consequences.<EOL>
An initial ceiling of EUR 50 000 and a further one of EUR 100 000 are more than adequate for the states whose banking systems have no long-established tradition, as is the case with Romania and other former Communist states.<EOL>
At the same time, we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right.<EOL>
From 2009 all least developed countries should benefit from the same guaranteed price as that provided for in the ACP Sugar Protocol.<EOL>
There is an important role for Parliament to play here.<EOL>
I am sometimes amazed that the arguments which at that time were ranged against the southward enlargement of the European Union are coming today from those countries which were at the time accepted into the European Union.<EOL>
Mr President, distinguished Members of Parliament, this Commission hit the ground running.<EOL>
Commissioner, a few years ago, we ran campaigns against the torture used by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes.<EOL>
There are even conflicts, such as the conflict in the Western Sahara, where the European Union is doing precisely nothing.<EOL>
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes<EOL>
I think it is worth pointing out in this regard that, on the one hand, there is a clause for reviewing the Agency's remit, before 31 December 2009.<EOL>
It was a close result, but the committee voted to grant extremely broad protection to the importer, with the consequence that the Community, to which revenue is due, would have to bear the whole risk rather than it being fairly distributed.<EOL>
I am sure those who were not able to speak were very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comments.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, the media play a very special and important role in our democratic society.<EOL>
Nor has the USA been so intent on combating inflation.<EOL>
The fall in the demand for cars in the EU is very serious, and production in the second quarter of 2009 decreased by almost 40%, a situation which threatens to jeopardise even more jobs, not only in Spain, but throughout the EU.<EOL>
However, for once it is not the Commission that is responsible for these omissions, but rather the governments of the Member States, which up to now have been very reluctant to reveal the truth about the nuclear industry’s inherited and future liabilities.<EOL>
This could seem ridiculous, but it is not at all.<EOL>
This will be delivered, I think, in the parliamentary procedure in a very transparent and open way, as it is in Parliament.<EOL>
More specifically, regarding the two questions that have been asked, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that, overall, measures concerning the physical security of nuclear plants are an area of national competence.<EOL>
I therefore request my speaking time in accordance with what had been arranged until the last minute.<EOL>
Of course, there are certain honourable Members present now in this House who disagree.<EOL>
I would like to make it clear that the experts who are going to be appointed for the decisions on this important initiative will certainly have the highest professional credentials to make sure that they choose not only the best and highest value sites, but also ideas.<EOL>
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the PPE Group, I urge the European Parliament to give the green light to this very important agreement.<EOL>
All things considered, the distinction between coregulation and self-regulation is appreciated here. In the first case, the instruments have to be included in a binding legal framework giving the Council and Parliament the right to participate and adopt objectives, providing for public access and participation and introducing effective monitoring and sanction mechanisms.<EOL>
Producers' organisations need to be promoted that are capable of positioning themselves in the market, concentrating supply.<EOL>
However, 10 years after the Ottawa Convention, there is still no reason to be cheerful.<EOL>
When the chips are down, commercial and strategic interests are often deemed more important than human rights.<EOL>
I have only one other brief point to mention to my fellow Members.<EOL>
We are speaking today about the 70th anniversary of Franco’s coup.<EOL>
Four principles have guided the work of our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we have preserved them throughout the debate.<EOL>
In other words, I personally would have been prepared to go further in this.<EOL>
We therefore agree with the regulation's objective and with the approach proposed by the Commission.<EOL>
I agree, as I said before, with most of the remarks that have been made today on the human rights issue, which is linked, as many Members have said, to the elections that will take place very soon in March.<EOL>
Under the previous regime we also saw a growing abuse of human rights, of people such as the Sindhi.<EOL>
And I am not alone in this.<EOL>
I just wonder because, although you set a specific date for units 1 and 2, saying that they would be closed down before the end of 2002 - which in my view is quite a long way off because, as you know, we are afraid of an accident in any one of the four reactors, which would be disastrous both for Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, as well as for neighbouring Greece and Europe too, since, as you know, these installations are very dangerous - what is stopping you from setting a date for the closure of reactors 3 and 4? And why are you keeping them open until 2006, or even longer as you will no doubt turn round and tell us in the future?<EOL>
Burma/Myanmar is a good example of that.<EOL>
If we do not listen to the expectations of a younger, older and increasingly numerous public, and if we remain deaf to the requests of new users of coastal and continental waters, we will truly fail in our work as the legislators and representatives of our fellow citizens.<EOL>
What remains for us to do?<EOL>
<EOL>
Fishermen in the UK, particularly along the south coast in the 10 metre boats, are often badly affected by imbalanced quotas and subsidies to other national fishing fleets.<EOL>
It represents an initial contribution, and the European Parliament has done well to get down to work, to take a lead in this debate, and to endeavour to set out a position in the future discussion of the common fisheries policy after 2002.<EOL>
As has been said quite rightly today, the Directive impinges deeply on the administrative and legal systems of many countries.<EOL>
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maaten.<EOL>
We must exploit them not simply to produce electricity, but also for heating and cooling buildings, since that alone accounts for more than 40% of the use of all energy in Europe.<EOL>
A country may be a great economic power, it may even be the envy of many others for its missiles, its strength, its powers of veto, but, if human rights are not respected and enforced, it is a society without values, an under-developed society.<EOL>
Examples already supported under the Sixth Framework Programme include mammography with molecular imaging or the application of positron emission tomography - PET - specifically designed for breast cancer examination.<EOL>
The candidates have stated that they accept their respective nominations.<EOL>
Various aspects of the issue have been mentioned, from development cooperation to birth rate policies.<EOL>
<EOL>
I realise that this was one of the objectives of the German Presidency, but it conflicts with the European Parliament's objectives. And as the President of the Commission pointed out, it is clear that a new interinstitutional agreement will be needed as the Berlin agreements are developed, an agreement that takes account of Parliament's opinions.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
This effect of the gas war is no less important than the temporary problems experienced by consumers during a harsh winter.<EOL>
This is the price which we have to pay in order to emerge from the crisis.<EOL>
It is important that this House supports the principle that each case should be discussed and judged on its merits alone.<EOL>
Other actors, too - this Parliament, all 27 Member States, the regional authorities, the national Parliaments, the local authorities and every municipality in the European Union - play a very important role in the effective development of European citizenship.<EOL>
Have you already considered some kind of flexibility mechanism or would you prefer us to apply Article 203?<EOL>
The third question is about anti-personnel mines.<EOL>
Opening of the sitting<EOL>
I would like to reply to some of the points raised.<EOL>
The recent agreement in Cancún on action to reduce emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation (known as 'REDD') will facilitate further Commission support for developing countries.<EOL>
   - Mr President, this is the second time that France has rejected a treaty of political union.<EOL>
Electronic communications networks and services<EOL>
Do not all these factors contribute powerfully to a potential reduction in tension in the Middle East?<EOL>
It points out an important aspect in development aid that the Commission should, in my opinion, seriously consider.<EOL>
I agree that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms, given the commitments made by the EU in this field to spend 0.7% of its Gross National Income (GNI) on Official Development Assistance by 2015.<EOL>
<EOL>
.<EOL>
While thanking the President-in-Office for her reply and expressing the strongest support for the decision to appeal against the WTO ruling on bananas, in view of the devastating effect this decision could have on the fragile economies of Caribbean and other countries, some of which rely in some cases for more than 50 % of their foreign exchange earnings on bananas, will the President-in-Office do everything possible to ensure that we fight to the last ditch on this issue?<EOL>
I also wish to highlight the very fine idea of declaring 2011 European year of volunteering.<EOL>
The completely arbitrary definition of terrorism provides the clearest indication of all that the war on terror has little to do with combating terrorism and instead has as its primary objective the erosion of fundamental rights in the EU.<EOL>
It is truly necessary to make use of the best experience of individual countries and to channel structural funds to addressing the problem with the participation of Roma themselves – this is really the key point in this regard.<EOL>
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe regard it as self-evident that the public sector must safeguard the provision of certain services.<EOL>
However, we will not take part in the vote on the amendments for a fundamental legal reason: we are national Members representing 15 different nations, not a single European nation.<EOL>
I will certainly pass your best wishes to my colleague, Stavros Dimas, for his recovery so that he might join you in the committee shortly.<EOL>
The police refused entry into Germany for dozens of football fans who wanted to attend the 2006 football World Cup.<EOL>
Secondly, we have an obligation towards our citizens to rectify the things that have occurred during this period, that is, during our, and your, term in office.<EOL>
We must now join forces and urge the national governments to make a success of Nice.<EOL>
Two worlds were pitted against each other - the wine-growing areas of the south and those of the north.<EOL>
It is a good thing that the European Parliament is paying particular attention to the human dimension of this conflict, and that it is calling on the warring parties to free hostages, to treat the civilian population humanely, and to observe the Geneva Convention of 1949.<EOL>
You have had the foresight, Prime Minister, to give Raoul Wallenberg the place he deserves in history.<EOL>
Therefore it is in everybody's interests – including the various actors and stakeholders – that we have a properly regulated financial sector and that risk is properly assessed.<EOL>
We are also critical of some aspects, and there are certain things we would like to see.<EOL>
Also, if pension reforms are as essential as they are made out to be, which I personally do not believe they are, other examples of successful programmes could also be found.<EOL>
For the time being, suspending our cooperation has not been decided, but disbursement of our financial commitments related to budgetary support has been put on hold.<EOL>
Parliament's position following the vote on the budget in October has been accepted almost in its entirety by the Council.<EOL>
In this regard, I believe that it is they, at the end of the day, who are in the best position to provide added value for local products.<EOL>
Moreover, people are not even allowed to ask questions about such matters, as was shown by the recent attack by Vladimir Putin on a female journalist from Niezavisima Gazieta, which reduced the woman to tears.<EOL>
Of those applications checked, over 40% were inaccurate.<EOL>
We are very much behind you in calling a number of conferences on the subject, and that will build up our optimism for Europe.<EOL>
I sincerely hope that Member States roll them out even-handedly.<EOL>
These are all lines of action on which the Commission will be working from this year, 2005, onwards, again with the idea that Europe can make a difference, in comparison with action by individual Member States.<EOL>
I particularly welcome Parliament's additional proposals because they make it easier to decide who, for example, should bear the costs at the end of the day, namely the Member State asking for help, or to decide which regulations should apply if officials are active in another Member State.<EOL>
First, in the enlargement process we desperately need additional social safeguard measures and a socially controlled opening of the labour market for workers from central and Eastern Europe, particularly in this sector.<EOL>
There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded.<EOL>
If we introduce harmonisation that is limited only to the Member States of the European Union, it is highly probable that we will witness the flight of capital to third countries.<EOL>
The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes.<EOL>
Mr President, on a point of order.<EOL>
We have to continue at European Union level the work we have done so far to ensure that in all Member States, we raise the level of detection of diseases, the level of access to adequate treatment, the quality of treatment monitoring and the quality of medical care given to patients.<EOL>
The time has now come for a transition to a market-based, insurance-based system that liberates farmers without upsetting the domestic or global market.<EOL>
So, no response at all, no real response to the demands and protests of tens of thousands of demonstrators - and, more generally, of a very broad sector of European public opinion - who reject or challenge a globalisation that is essentially financial and commercial.<EOL>
After all, this somewhat technical subject of animal feed of course fits in with the wider debate on food safety and rising food prices.<EOL>
It was called the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, in particular in the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and in the public digital mobile networks.<EOL>
These elections are a call for realism for all of us and a call for an end to hypocrisy in the international community.<EOL>
Draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (all sections) (<EOL>
I share the opinion of the Commission on setting clear priorities and long-term planning.<EOL>
Mr President, the Commission thanks the Committee on Legal Affairs for its question and Mr Lehne for doing a great job here this evening.<EOL>
There was not a single minister able to explain that.<EOL>
I agree that granting trade preferences may not help directly the people who have suffered as a result of flooding.<EOL>
Of course, we need points of emphasis and we need to set priorities, and that is the idea behind earmarking.<EOL>
One way of doing this would, in actual fact, be to ensure that the European Development Fund, or EDF, was incorporated into the ordinary budget, something which we in Parliament have always demanded.<EOL>
The meeting allowed the European Union and the Russian Federation to look at current global issues, including crisis situations and what are known as the frozen conflicts in the region.<EOL>
My final point - because I believe an official rebuttal is needed - is on the Latvian electoral law.<EOL>
Mr Farage, I do not want to prolong this, but can I just make the observation that this is incorrect.<EOL>
Nevertheless, we should recognize that the freeze at 1997 levels that the Commission is seeking is really pitched at 1992 levels, if account is not taken of average Community inflation and when there are no compensatory mechanisms for making up part of the income.<EOL>
As a new Member - and this is just one example - I approached the European Investment Bank, and I felt as if I were approaching a sanctuary for privileged, all-powerful fat cats who had been released from the rules of democracy and therefore from their obligation to citizens.<EOL>
If the Commission does not do so within a reasonable period of time, then we must not hesitate to censure it.<EOL>
President-in-Office of the Council. - Sport activity is subject to the application of EU law today and, as the honourable Member rightly points out, when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, it will provide the EU with a legal basis allowing it to contribute to the promotion of European sporting issues while taking into account the specific nature of sport, its structures, based on voluntary activities, and its social and educational function.<EOL>
This is driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges.<EOL>
Finally, the fourth action under 'environment' relates to the city of tomorrow and cultural heritage.<EOL>
That would make it so much more difficult for other countries in the League of Death.<EOL>
Mr President, I would be exaggerating if I said that we cannot wait for the Commission' s legislative proposals.<EOL>
We are convinced that the EU will continue its efforts to build on the encouraging developments that have undoubtedly taken place and to nurture, in the framework of an intensive dialogue with its UN partners, an effective UN Human Rights Council and above all one that acts in the interests of the people concerned.<EOL>
We are all aware that Libya is persisting in a dictatorial regime, and is systematically violating international conventions on fundamental rights and freedoms.<EOL>
In order to help the Ombudsman to keep to this commitment Parliament will need to ensure in the budget procedure that his office receives the necessary additional staff.<EOL>
In Laos, this is the result of a programme of the ruling communist party, which treats Christianity as a religion representing Western imperialism.<EOL>
Failure to respect Community preference, profiting Chinese honey that now accounts for 30 % of world production or Mexican or Argentine honeys, requires compensation in the form of a premium to make up for that situation.<EOL>
I should like to express my condolences to the families of all those who have died or disappeared.<EOL>
Is this solution under serious discussion with these countries?<EOL>
The challenges that we face, though, leave us no alternative to action on a global scale.<EOL>
It prevents poor farmers from earning their own income by exporting to Europe.<EOL>
We should in any event like to know a little more about this Blue Card, Commissioner, given that today - as you have recalled - only 5% of immigrant workers are highly skilled, as opposed to 95% who are unskilled.<EOL>
The differences in wealth between the peoples of the Union and between citizens of a single country would continue to increase.<EOL>
I think it is important to state that the advancement of the accession process for south-eastern European countries is prominently in the interests of the European Union, as stability, prosperity and the progress of reform in the region is important not only for the candidate countries but for the entire European Union.<EOL>
That is an exceptionally positive thing.<EOL>
This is why we have some small differences of opinion, although on the whole I am happy with the combination of ideas and consensus between us.<EOL>
In spite of this fact, protection for autochthonous minorities in Europe is not seen as a priority.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
The debate is closed.<EOL>
We have made a clear decision in favour of the European model of agriculture, which means that we are committed to maintaining multifunctional and sustainable farming in all regions of Europe. Further development and research are inextricably linked.<EOL>
All too many European wage earners work 60 or 65 hours a week while millions remain unemployed.<EOL>
The Danish Social Democrats do not agree with this position.<EOL>
Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form.<EOL>
Its profitability is questionable, there are deep concerns as regards safety and, most importantly, the environmental impact would be terrible if we were to build a pylon taller than the Empire State Building on the outskirts of the city of Messina.<EOL>
This could have been done in this part-session.<EOL>
We all agree on the need to promote the Union' s processed food industry competitive position.<EOL>
Trans-European networks are definitely one of the instruments we can use.<EOL>
Should we now tell them that they have been deceived?<EOL>
This has the immediate effect that a root-and-branch reform should be undertaken and this is more than a few institutional reforms.<EOL>
We receive news from Kok Ksor and the Montagnard Foundation, for example on 28 April when Y-Tao Eban was killed by Vietnamese police and security forces, and on 15 April when two Montaguard Degar children were killed by four Vietnamese police officers.<EOL>
Madam President, Madam Commissioner, the rapporteur cooperated well with this Parliament and has taken on board the most important issues from all groups.<EOL>
It is therefore necessary that the Commission and Council make every effort to put an end to the possible existence of such prisons.<EOL>
In order to exchange mutual experiences it is important that contacts between ourselves and colleagues from candidate countries are intensified.<EOL>
In 2011, a comprehensive text about protecting the victims, all kinds of victims - for me there is not a victim here, a victim there and a third category of victims - all kinds of victims have to be considered.<EOL>
   Mr President, I am not certain I can follow the eloquence of Mr Fatuzzo in my explanation of vote.<EOL>
It is for that reason that we cannot vote for the latter part of Amendment No 20, despite all the real concerns about copyright.<EOL>
Please can we look at civil justice, which is the other side of the internal market, making it function for our companies and our citizens?<EOL>
The progress of the vote demonstrates that this match has been fixed by the forces of the European one-way street, as an alibi for their undemocratic decision.<EOL>
I have to say that I am amazed the Council is not represented in the House today. Nonetheless, the Council must realise that there is only one way of dealing with the challenges before us, and that is by reaching agreement with Parliament.<EOL>
The Tampere European Council in 1999 agreed to work towards the creation of a common European Union asylum system on the basis of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention.<EOL>
Bio-diversity would have been a thousand times greater if man had not interfered with nature, and the link between a polluted environment and health is evident.<EOL>
There certainly was a failure, but it was in an area for which the governments were clearly responsible.<EOL>
The Lisbon Treaty was agreed precisely to increase the European dimension; to reinforce the powers of the European Parliament; to make it easier to take decisions by qualified majority voting; and to reinforce the role of the Commission in economic surveillance and external affairs.<EOL>
According to the Danish Foreign Minister, Niels Helveg Petersen, this is "a blast from the past' .<EOL>
It deals with different levels of control, depending on the risks posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal.<EOL>
I believe that, although this text comes at a very late hour - which I regret somewhat - it illustrates the extent to which Parliament is now largely the guarantor of the European general interest.<EOL>
Having said that, I should like to give a clear reply to the question raised by Mr Gargani.<EOL>
In this case, we are talking about the Commission, but the legal action is being taken against the person who revealed the accounts scandal.<EOL>
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.<EOL>
First, we want to agree on new commitments to enhance implementation, in particular as regards the execution of the Convention on Biological Diversity's programmes on protected areas and forest biodiversity.<EOL>
We have adopted fundamental measures in this area and they were agreed on after a very serious, challenging and controversial debate, where we juggled with the details right up to the European Council in June, producing a result which perhaps did not satisfy everyone, as there are some who consider the world to be over-regulated.<EOL>
(SV) Mr President, it is important is that we be clear about what we want.<EOL>
We have taken note of it, and will look into it.<EOL>
The teacher did not.<EOL>
I was very surprised by this judgment and I would very much like to know the Commissioner's point of view on this matter, in the context of the lasting impact of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter on current and future EU legislation.<EOL>
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Bendit has the floor, and your behaviour in this matter does little for Parliament's reputation.<EOL>
I also welcome the Council's recent conclusions, which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament.<EOL>
   Obviously, microbicides could revolutionise AIDS prevention throughout the world.<EOL>
Similarly, another aspect that we must discuss together and concerning which we must take action, is voluntary and cooperative activities.<EOL>
Whether progress will be made or not will depend on the efforts and willpower of the Member States and companies involved.<EOL>
Finally, I should like to remind the House that there are another two physical agents in the workplace, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields, and that we need to start work on the next two directives, which are also very important and affect large numbers of workers.<EOL>
It is with good reason that the REACH legislation provides for review periods, and we should observe the periods decided on by the legislator very closely.<EOL>
Nevertheless, the Greens welcome this move by the European Parliament towards greater comprehensibility, which will enable consumers to choose freely between products that contain GMOs and those that do not.<EOL>
I would like to thank Ms Figueiredo for her report on minimum income schemes.<EOL>
A few figures suffice to remind us of the value of commerce.<EOL>
The rapporteur is very unclear in the way she proposes that the entire EUR 55 million of European taxpayers money should be appropriated to an EU propaganda programme which, in our view, would be unnecessary, expensive and ineffective.<EOL>
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.<EOL>
No migration testing is available to test how much of these chemicals enters people's bodies.<EOL>
The fact is that while, on the one hand, competition and the opportunity of choosing between suppliers of these services, including from outside the national territory, add to consumer freedom of choice, the differences in legislation may be the source of new problems.<EOL>
   .<EOL>
While I support the report's recommendations, the Parliament must continue to be ambitious in setting targets for aviation emissions in the EU ETS and look ahead to building upon Mr Liese's proposals for the general review of the ETS.<EOL>
We have an image problem in the eyes of the parties to the numerous conflicts in the world today.<EOL>
For several decades he has had professional experience of elderly people's issues, which is also evident from this thorough and very professionally prepared report.<EOL>
Like the Americans, we Europeans must encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this vital opportunity to relaunch the peace process and do everything possible to support the parties in their search for a just and lasting solution.<EOL>
Such signals are expected. I say that because I was recently in the three Baltic states with Pauline Green and saw how hungry they are for signals from Europe.<EOL>
It therefore strikes me as clear that in order to foster an integrated approach to urban policy, it is crucial to promote private-public partnerships and to effectively manage existing Community instruments to support urban policy.<EOL>
The Structural Funds, too, play an essential role in tackling social exclusion.<EOL>
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I am trying to simplify the work of Parliament and not to insist on formalities when I see that there is general agreement.<EOL>
Important meetings on this issue are scheduled for the next few months.<EOL>
What that means is that the report continues to contain a misrepresentation of the facts in which it is insinuated that Europol had employed members of the American secret services, something that is without any substance whatever and the very opposite of the truth.<EOL>
I will return to this point in a moment.<EOL>
Mr Van Buitenen should now be reinstated.<EOL>
I must strongly support the rapporteur and his suggestions that the Commission should be tackling the issues of major topics, such as the importance and the overall impact of the programme in relation to the agreed objectives rather than individual programmes.<EOL>
Twenty three Member States, including Ireland, have notified.<EOL>
Next year Brazil will have negative rates of growth: -2 or -3 %.<EOL>
The Council’s common position does not, however, give the NGOs such access.<EOL>
In that way, we are moving away from the end-of-pipe technology whereby we always have to consider what to do with the remains of cars.<EOL>
He said, 'I tell them the truth, and they never believe me'.<EOL>
This means that we have to be able to sustain our current efforts and maintain the right level of military resources.<EOL>
But having examined the case, I have no choice but to agree with what Mr Patten just said.<EOL>
Is it permissible for doctors in some countries to refuse to accept a valid E111, claiming it should be renewed every year, when this is no longer the case, and then make a considerable charge for the consultation and medicines?<EOL>
It will inevitably lead to distorted economic policies which take insufficient account of other worthwhile policy objectives for the conduct of macro-economic policy, and by that I mean growth, investment and employment.<EOL>
Firstly, with regard to flexibility, it is claimed that Lisbon and flexibility are no longer compatible with this legislation, but that is not the case, for the reference period for measuring 48 hours has been extended from 4 to 12 months.<EOL>
I am very much in favour of clear labelling.<EOL>
Mr President, it is always daunting to follow the measured tread of Mr Bowis as he spreads reassurance through the Chamber.<EOL>
That is the first project.<EOL>
We offer you our co-operation.<EOL>
I would like to add that the main ideas have been advanced by the European Parliament for decades, so it does not seem particularly original.<EOL>
They will no longer be able to run their own economies.<EOL>
If none are forthcoming, we shall have no option but to support the censure motion.<EOL>
Subject: US-Cuba relations<EOL>
rapporteur. - Mr President, there are no amendments to the common position.<EOL>
I also agree with the rapporteur that there must be consistency between the achievement of these goals and the funding allocated to them, and the new mechanism for enhanced economic governance in the EU should be an opportunity to study how best to accomplish these five objectives.<EOL>
I would like to tell you that this enormous contribution with more than 1, 000 comments and recommendations is exactly what we were seeking. Our wish was to create a large debate, an open debate at a European level capable of revealing the importance of the sector in question.<EOL>
I think that would be a serious mistake.<EOL>
It is not a one-way process.<EOL>
A Europe of expanding membership and a visionary mission: for cooperation across borders and growth without barriers.<EOL>
I would urge the Commission not to ignore this important area.<EOL>
It is not the time for that.<EOL>
I call on Member States to take concrete measures which will be aimed at creating decent, sustainable jobs and will promote appropriate income and social protection schemes for preventing and reducing poverty, especially extreme poverty, and also to devise medium- and long-term strategies which will take the gender aspect into account and be integrated in all relevant policy areas.<EOL>
Only action of this kind would bear witness to an intention to truly serve the interests of the country.<EOL>
Therefore, I support the proposed postponement, so as to enable a new negotiating mandate to be presented, sooner rather than later, that takes account of our questions.<EOL>
I have in mind specific ideas, such as the commitment to more and better jobs. These should be jobs in which flexibility and stability need not threaten workers' rights.<EOL>
The overriding feature of the budget of any federal state – which is increasingly what we want our budget to be – must be its redistributive function.<EOL>
On the basis of the above considerations, we have decided not to vote against the report.<EOL>
Report (A5-0146/2003) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Statute for a European cooperative society (9923/2002 - C5-0485/2002 - 1991/0388(CNS))<EOL>
For example, lawyers are required to administer justice, and a notary’s duties include the drawing up of public instruments, while some professions have to obey very specific professional rules, as is the case with medical practitioners, pharmacists and many other liberal professions, where comparable rules and special structures exist.<EOL>
This is what the Council and Commission are doing, and this is also what we as Parliament should be doing.<EOL>
Madam President, I must insist on an issue which I have raised several times during these points of order.<EOL>
One of the proclaimed ambitions, I would point out, was to achieve full employment, whereas the figures of the Commission itself now indicate that, for the first time in ten years, we are destroying more jobs than we are creating.<EOL>
I readily acknowledge that it really is a sore point, but I must ask you to take this special envoy's request seriously and try to see whether certain movements that have taken place in the last few days might not be conducive to a solution after all, making a joint mission possible.<EOL>
That means that we will face a major pressure on public budgets in future, because our pension systems are at risk of being underfunded.<EOL>
It will have to be implemented and applied through the national reform programmes.<EOL>
This is denying the political dimension of human rights under Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement and contradicting the Barcelona process based on respect for fundamental rights.<EOL>
Parliament's firmness and the negotiating skills of rapporteur Philippe Monfils worked the miracle of forcing the Council to abandon its undemocratic arrogance and come to the negotiating table.<EOL>
Lithuania is a member of the European Union.<EOL>
Because we are talking here about the common principles and values to be defended - equality of opportunities and equality of access - and not a mere commercial negotiation.<EOL>
Despite a willingness to establish common ground, there were quite a few differences of opinion.<EOL>
The excessively long procedures for awarding public procurement contracts can delay realisation of Structural Funds, and so contribute to the low level of absorption.<EOL>
However, today’s political reality is that there is insufficient support for the hefty package of amendment proposals by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where it enjoyed a narrow majority.<EOL>
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.<EOL>
It has therefore surprised me a great deal during the debate on this issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that, for example, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which normally attaches incredible importance to doing something for handicapped people in the EU, has not shown greater interest in efforts to prevent people from being handicapped by damage to their hearing, for that is at all events the best strategy of all.<EOL>
The local prosecutor characterised this as a breach of Article 26(2) of the German Assembly Law, because it was held to be an assembly conducted without prior authorisation by, or information to, the appropriate authorities.<EOL>
These include the establishment of networks for NGOs across Europe, support for collaboration between NGOs and authorities in the same field, measures to protect the target groups and to prevent violence against those belonging to them, studies, research work aimed at discovering the causes of violence, at preventing it, and at the support of groups at risk and their reintegration into society.<EOL>
During his trial he was refused the right to defending counsel and was subjected to various forms of physical violence.<EOL>
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East.<EOL>
Such a sum would provide one portion of fruit per pupil per day and at the same time would enable the scheme to target not only schoolchildren between the ages of 6 to 10 years but also younger children in pre-school institutions.<EOL>
According to experts, around 90% of 12 to 17 year-olds chat on the Internet.<EOL>
This will make it possible gradually to establish a broader base of research activities throughout Europe.<EOL>
I should like to add that I very much agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Blak, that we must also look at another problem for drivers.<EOL>
One key aspect that was widely acknowledged during the debate was education and training.<EOL>
I know the Commission values the findings of this report and I look forward with great interest to its own report.<EOL>
<EOL>
Could I therefore ask through you that the President refer the matter of interpreting the rules on this point to the committee that is responsible for interpreting the rules, namely the Committee on Constitutional Affairs?<EOL>
   Madam President, I was surprised to find out about the initial steps that were taken towards reflection within the European institutions.<EOL>
The Cold War is over and the EU has a unique historic opportunity to be able to bring together a Europe, which has too often been the setting for bloody and destructive wars.<EOL>
For the first time ever, the European Parliament is being so responsible right from the start of the budget debate.<EOL>
I have the document we are discussing in front of me, and I was both surprised and disappointed to see what it contains.<EOL>
You have therefore furnished us with proof that, within the Commission, you possess all the elements needed to publish this action plan in all its parts.<EOL>
I do not know what is happening about this.<EOL>
On the basis of these budgetary constraints for 2005, new entities such as the European School of Administration may have to be delayed unless savings are made by launching such bodies.<EOL>
I wish to point out that this industry directly or indirectly involves no less than 5 million jobs.<EOL>
It is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy.<EOL>
I tabled an amendment that recommended the disclosure of information on emissions even when there was some other kind of data protection involved.<EOL>
Some speakers (Mr Kaczmarek and Mrs Tomaszewska, I believe) have mentioned this issue, as do recital G and paragraph 8 of the proposal for a common resolution, but I want to point out that the drafting of paragraph 8 restricts action against piracy to defending vessels carrying humanitarian aid, so it would be better to vote separately on this paragraph and vote against it.<EOL>
What are we trying to achieve with this convention?<EOL>
Of course, we need to ensure that Israel can preserve its democratic system and its rights in its own capital, and the European Union can be involved in the peace process, and it should be, but in a diplomatic role and not as a doctor or judge.<EOL>
We call for urgent action by OLAF to monitor the use of the funds appropriated up to now and to ensure that future funds are correctly managed.<EOL>
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.<EOL>
The final report will come out in July 2009.<EOL>
With regard to maritime transport security, passenger safety is of vital importance to us, but it is also important to take account of the transport of goods.<EOL>
First, to build measures to further trust, social cohesion and security.<EOL>
in writing. - I welcome the renewed referral to Parliament of the draft Council decision and thus, the continuation of the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland.<EOL>
I would like the Polish Parliament’s voice to be heard, as it was the first to give an official welcome to a representative of the Ukrainian opposition, and to protest at the lies.<EOL>
The original text was, quite rightly, heavily opposed and indeed heavily amended.<EOL>
The offer made to Turkey is concrete and substantial, whatever Ankara's disappointed reaction.<EOL>
I want to make a few things clear here at the outset.<EOL>
I hope we can invite him to the next Strasbourg session and have a debate – maybe not at such a late hour as this but earlier in the day – on the developments in the stock exchanges.<EOL>
Transfers of appropriations: see Minutes<EOL>
Our instinct in this Parliament is always to legislate, rather than use the legal arsenal already at our disposal.<EOL>
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, eating and drinking - hardly anything could be more commonplace and self-evident for us.<EOL>
Full ESDP missions are needed to have a realistic chance of solving the frozen conflicts in Transnistria and the Caucasus.<EOL>
Nonetheless, I would ask whether the full text of the Commission's statement and Mr Prodi's statement today could be incorporated not just in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings but also in the Minutes, because it was a very significant statement and should be recorded in our Minutes, so that we have a proper record of what the Commission has undertaken to do.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Laperrouze.<EOL>
Many treasures are yet to be unearthed.<EOL>
17.<EOL>
However, my group cannot share Mr Vigenin's view.<EOL>
There are thousands of childless couples who could give a future to these children.<EOL>
Do not persist in trying to resurrect a federalism that is a thing of the past.<EOL>
I should like to know whether this information is indeed accurate, particularly as regards the members of the Committee of Independent Experts who already receive an allowance from the Community budget. I should like to know whether, in these cases, the above sum will be added to their allowance or not.<EOL>
I also support the proposal from the Commission contained in Articles 24 and 25, which will greatly ease the movement of workers within the EU market.<EOL>
There must be no doubt about it, that is the reason why I have decided to declare this amendment out of order, knowing full well that the decision would be criticized.<EOL>
I believe that it is important to encourage representation of women in all political, social and economic bodies of the agricultural sector, to ensure that women are participating on an equal basis.<EOL>
Gross domestic product per capita is estimated at well below pre-war levels.<EOL>
So I was particularly concerned that the 1 euro and 2 euro coins were to use alloys containing nickel, as the Commission proposed.<EOL>
My problem is not so much the Council as the policy that the future Commission President will follow.<EOL>
It is very difficult for the Swedish Presidency to determine exactly when a violation takes place and when not.<EOL>
We want this change - and here I am speaking both to the Council and to the Commission.<EOL>
As rapporteur for the SEM 2000 programmes and decentralised management measures, Mr Kuhne has dealt with these questions in detail and I should like to thank him for his work in this area.<EOL>
It used to be the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs, which as we all know meets undemocratically behind closed doors, so that we would have been kept totally in the dark.<EOL>
The European Parliament, it says, shall consist of representatives of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community.<EOL>
We have often been able to get through the entire list - as we were indeed able to do this evening - for it is one of the privileges of the MEPs to be able to speak, and Monday evenings always provide an opportunity to do so.<EOL>
It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems.<EOL>
All that remains is to make their funding transparent, not so much to conform to rules on competition as to enable public service to really diversify its activities and enrich its services.<EOL>
As a result of our action, we were assured by Commissioner Van Miert that the Commission would prosecute this to the very end.<EOL>
The market is crucial to the development of seaports.<EOL>
By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizen after all, to have this proposal enter into force swiftly.<EOL>
Consumer education, therefore, is more effective than rules, so that consumers can exercise their freedom of choice on the basis of reliable criteria.<EOL>
I shall not exaggerate, and thank you for your generosity.<EOL>
It is not really possible to work in these conditions.<EOL>
In order to speed up tomorrow morning' s work, I propose that we draw lots now to select the six tellers.<EOL>
I genuinely believe that your experience will be of use to us in all our future work.<EOL>
The events which have taken place in Dagestan and Chechnya in recent weeks render it almost imperative that this pressing problem be resolved through military action.<EOL>
I support the idea that taking into account increasingly mathematical justifications for the measures taken should not serve as a pretext for calling into question part of the Union's policy to assist the ORs nor deter actors by imposing conditions on them which are too difficult to meet.<EOL>
These challenges require the EU to be able to take political decisions, allocate budget resources and engage in activity whereby we can make advances.<EOL>
The greatest challenges, as proposed by this group, were the elimination of poverty, the establishment of equitable globalisation and the management of climate change.<EOL>
The current practice very obviously favours the Americans, and I also expect the Commission to act quickly after the Court of Justice has given a decision in this matter.<EOL>
Before we gather again in Strasbourg there will be another anniversary.<EOL>
Its political support and the presence of its military units stationed in areas of conflict and the surrounding areas are crucial to stability; and it is equally important that genuine respect be shown for the territorial integrity of the bordering countries.<EOL>
That is why I voted for the report on the European Agency for Reconstruction.<EOL>
The European Union has been incapable of playing a significant, decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<EOL>
We are aware that this summit comes at a time when both the presidential and Duma elections in Russia are imminent.<EOL>
International fisheries agreements are also an instrument; they are a means for bringing democracy and development to the countries concerned.<EOL>
The debate is to continue in the Council.<EOL>
The Mont Blanc tunnel is one of the elements, but it is not the only one, and the traffic which has been diverted from the Mont Blanc tunnel is undoubtedly causing an overload in other areas - and I could mention other tunnels which you know even better than me.<EOL>
Right to freedom of expression, right, also, to the freedom of association, including for opponents of power, including for people who meet up to say things which you do not like or which the dominant majority do not like.<EOL>
Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth.<EOL>
I therefore want to stick to the Commission's original idea on comitology.<EOL>
A requirement for free elections is that the citizens find out what the parties stand for.<EOL>
So in order to achieve the objective, the action plan must come from the Member States and not just from the Commission, even though I support the Commission - and Parliament - in taking the lead.<EOL>
That is why we have endless protests - and very valid protests - in Ireland about the closure of local hospitals and local services.<EOL>
Does it refer to a medicinal product which has the same structure as existing medicinal products but with a very small change, or does it actually refer to medicinal products with a new chemical structure?<EOL>
This is a splendid environmental slogan, but no one defines what we mean by it in Europe, and so we should not be surprised if the loopholes are exploited.<EOL>
Mrs Díez de Rivera, according to the Rules of this House I can only have the bells rung when I become aware that the rule for the tabling of a motion has been invoked.<EOL>
Making such statements simply cannot be allowed, not even in the European Parliament.<EOL>
   Mr President, I too would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Buzek, who has been very fair and inclusive in the way he has steered this difficult proposal through Parliament.<EOL>
The strategy must take account of the various situations, which differ from one country to another.<EOL>
If we accept these amendments, then together with the Commission proposal we believe it will make a good directive.<EOL>
Also, in the Growth Initiative, which was adopted on 11 November 2003, we find the concept of ‘quick starts’, that is to say projects that can be implemented quite quickly.<EOL>
That is what I want to say and we have only ourselves to blame: why did Parliament not call for a European referendum, as we proposed?<EOL>
I would also argue that it is essential that novel foods must not endanger the lives of consumers or mislead them, since the health and protection of citizens would be dangerously threatened.<EOL>
I would therefore ask you to explain to Parliament and to the public at large that we began discussing this issue some time ago and that this transparency register had already been agreed upon before the story you are referring to even happened.<EOL>
Of course, I sympathize with the fact that Armenia is doing everything it can to improve its economic situation.<EOL>
Until there is a seat in the middle, I will keep moving across.<EOL>
As I recently told Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission continues to make good progress on this matter.<EOL>
- (LV) Madam President, Mr Vondra, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those who have studied history in Europe, the majority I believe, know that the Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland.<EOL>
There is of course a possible case for some support, some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact.<EOL>
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.<EOL>
These are record numbers for the EU, which therefore needs to adopt a common strategy to deal with this problem.<EOL>
Important steps have been taken, but this text does not serve the purpose, which is to create a harmonised framework.<EOL>
Nor must the situation arise in which citizens, and particularly those living near borders, are able to play on the differences between countries to gain an advantage.<EOL>
Last week, Israel broke off diplomatic contacts with the Palestinian Authority after three young settlers were killed near Hebron.<EOL>
I believe this is the least we owe to the House.<EOL>
Welcome<EOL>
As we have denounced all too often up to now, China is placing goods on the European markets that are counterfeit or that do not comply with EU legislation, with quality and safety standards.<EOL>
   I suggest that we suspend the sitting for a few minutes while we wait for the Council representative to arrive.<EOL>
In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on.<EOL>
It is the fruit of a lengthy labour.<EOL>
It is being done in this way, by coordinating economic policies.<EOL>
European legislators should make greater use of these instruments as they can improve the legislative process by showing the possible impacts of their policy decisions.<EOL>
People's everyday lives have been shattered and the relief organisations cannot operate in the region.<EOL>
The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr Jørgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against Amendment 2, tabled by Mr Tomczak and Mr Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group.<EOL>
If you want results, you have to act and sometimes take risks.<EOL>
I should like to ask the Commission what steps it has taken since the Haug resolution of last July on the guidelines for the budget: that resolution clearly asked for a consideration of alternative forms of finance in relation to outbreaks of disease.<EOL>
I am grateful for Parliament's support.<EOL>
In view of the foregoing, I voted against the second part of Amendment 83.<EOL>
We at the Committee on Development and Cooperation have every confidence that we can bring about this reform thanks to the agreements we have reached with the Commission.<EOL>
Human rights issues, including the death penalty and respect for the fundamental rights of ethnic minorities, are systematically raised during our regular political contacts and, in particular, during our human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities.<EOL>
Pursuant to the legislation of the United States, such an authority is and will be responsible for all cases of contravention of the rules on proper handling of personal data.<EOL>
I believe that we must allow a little time to pass and see what moves are made.<EOL>
These people will then be free to move to Britain if they wish.<EOL>
This is one of the reasons for the malfunctionings.<EOL>
Some of you, including Mr Maaten and Mr Lehne, have spoken in explicit terms and with appreciation about the series of conferences on the nature of Europe and the essence of the values we share.<EOL>
I will be sticking to my recommendation that you, Mr President, invite a Non-Inscrit to attend the Conference of Presidents.<EOL>
I know that Parliament shares that objective.<EOL>
I will not wish you good luck in your fishing, Mr Duisenberg, because, as an Italian from the south of Italy, I am afraid that it might bring you bad luck.<EOL>
I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the opening of a new trade round in which everyone will be talking about free and fair trade, what is happening in the shipbuilding industry is really quite ironic.<EOL>
That concludes the explanations of vote.<EOL>
The Tibetan people live in unique circumstances imposed by nature and have always been somewhat isolated from the surrounding world.<EOL>
What is carried out by an organization or perhaps by an individual or by a group of individuals is a difficult and complicated question.<EOL>
The European Union is the biggest donor, giving more than 50% of development aid.<EOL>
I would now like to turn briefly to the situation in the three eurozone countries to which I have already referred.<EOL>
Mr Wolf, I prefer what the speaker for the Greens, Joschka Fischer, recently said at the budget debate in the German Bundestag. 'A broad participation of employees in the capital gains in a company of coowners is the prerequisite for pension security' .<EOL>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a process of such historical significance as enlargement can only be approached on the basis of broad consensus.<EOL>
We, as the European Union, must activate all the mechanisms and potential for a good collaborative approach with the Balkans, but also the countries of the Balkans must take serious account of the fact that democracy and standards are the best guarantee of their development and their integration into the European Union.<EOL>
Madam President, I will do my best.<EOL>
(ES) Mr President, I welcome Mr Lewandowski, an old friend of this House who now sits on different benches to those of the Members.<EOL>
The presentation of the European Union’s annual report on human rights to your House in December, an occasion on which you traditionally highlight human rights priorities by presenting the Sakharov Prize, and your House’s response to that report, makes an important contribution towards that end.<EOL>
The European Union has raised this question a number of times with the US authorities.<EOL>
This report is well-balanced and represents an important contribution to resolving the institutional deadlock in which the Union finds itself at the earliest opportunity.<EOL>
We have to take account of the fact that there is an unholy and unhealthy relationship between developmental problems in Africa and conflict.<EOL>
Mr Medina rightly pointed out that all of the environmental legislation in the Community will have to be screened for penal compatibility, as it were, in the light of the new definitions of criminal offences.<EOL>
However, perhaps because the horizon always seems infinite, society finds it difficult to understand and accept that it is a limited resource and we therefore have to protect it like any other resource.<EOL>
Only now has it reached the top of the agenda, as the Commissioner responsible for immigration has stated that there will only be 100 000 refugees entering the Union each year in ten, fifteen years' time, which means that an average-sized industrialised country will only be receiving 5000 and industry, in particular, will be complaining of the lack of immigrants.<EOL>
Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):<EOL>
In developing countries half the harvest rots because it is not being stored or transported.<EOL>
In that sense the context has changed completely in the past couple of years.<EOL>
Parliament expresses its satisfaction in this motion for a resolution at the high implementation rate of IPA commitments in 2007 and its regret at the considerable delays both in approving the relevant regulations and implementing the programmes which started in 2008.<EOL>
Section VIII(B) - European Data Protection Supervisor, and<EOL>
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.<EOL>
This was noticeable in almost all speeches, the question of where the boundary is, beyond which we would guarantee rights to such an extent as to cripple important economic actors and small and medium-sized enterprises, whose situation we are trying to keep an eye on.<EOL>
What are now being negotiated are the percentages for the number of countries and the number of citizens.<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 strategy presents us with a specific challenge.<EOL>
In the light of the European Union's enlargement process, the Commission's proposal for reform of the Structural Funds acquires a particular importance for the future of European citizens.<EOL>
As regards using the Solidarity Fund, it is true that the serious drought and cold weather may be seen as a natural disaster and, as such, to generally fall within the scope of this fund.<EOL>
We all need to focus on making the new enlarged European Union relevant and responsive to our citizens.<EOL>
The European Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union agreed to establish the 'Youth in Action' programme, which puts into effect the legal framework to support non-formal learning activities for young people.<EOL>
This is the reason why we are calling on the European Council of 12 and 13 of December next, which will be examining the Agenda 2000 programme, to reject the agricultural proposals of the Commission. We are calling for a firm orientation in favour of community preference, with a view to what is already being called the 'Clinton Round.'<EOL>
That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action.<EOL>
Our rapporteur is of the opinion that these amendments impair the original text but we, of course, feel that they enhance it.<EOL>
It is our duty to act and to act quickly.<EOL>
However, Mr President, I must point out another aspect, which is that this cooperation and its effectiveness are important not only for the two continents of Latin America and Europe but also, due to the values defended by these two groups throughout the world, for the global context.<EOL>
Innovation partnerships should not result in additional complexity, but should instead be part of a simplification process.<EOL>
The funds generated by these taxes should be allocated solely to programmes aimed at informing the general public about ingredients and substances which can harm them.<EOL>
Thank you, President Prodi.<EOL>
<EOL>
We can no longer write out blank cheques.<EOL>
   Mr President, I have to acknowledge that, as Mr Cashman has said, even in my own constituency of London we continue to see prejudice and homophobic crime.<EOL>
Lithuania, my country, loses more than 1 500 people each year to suicide, and sadly this ranks us first in all of Europe, leaving behind even Russia and other post-Soviet countries.<EOL>
In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport, is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take, as well as on their future development?<EOL>
As Commissioner Mandelson said to Parliament's Committee on International Trade last week, we have turned a corner in these negotiations.<EOL>
Yesterday, the Conference of Presidents, which both Mr Watson and I attended, decided to ask the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, to forward to the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, the letters from the various committees of this House containing the outcomes of the hearings, so that he could take note of them and draw his own conclusions from them.<EOL>
There is some dispute as to which precautions are necessary and appropriate in order to achieve this aim.<EOL>
(RO) Madam President, although subsidised coal accounts for only a small proportion of the European Union's electricity production, the immediate and simultaneous closure of hard coal mines will have a considerable social impact in certain areas of Europe.<EOL>
We believe that export and production subsidies under the common agricultural policy must be abolished.<EOL>
It is one of the world's most polluted seas.<EOL>
For many years, Ukraine existed in a situation of constitutional and political disorder.<EOL>
However, I would be the last to say that democracy in Pakistan is in perfect condition.<EOL>
What is important is that it was decided post Stockholm to examine the method of open coordination on the question of pensions, taking account, of course, of the question of subsidiarity and the specific problems of each Member States.<EOL>
In truth, the lives of our disabled vary incredibly from country to country.<EOL>
It is designed to provide the excuse for a political project of the globalists to replace national democracy with new world order global governance.<EOL>
We also recognise the importance and urgency of defining thresholds for the adventitious presence of GMOs in seed lots of non-GM varieties and we are currently working on a proposal.<EOL>
I very much welcome the Commissioner's remarks and the fact that he says the Commission is doing everything possible to lessen the number of unsafe abortions taking place in the world, and indeed to reduce the need for abortions by giving and encouraging access to family planning and reproductive health matters.<EOL>
The subject of the Madrid Forum has also been raised.<EOL>
There is no antagonism between the position of the United States and that of the European Union regarding, for instance, NAFTA.<EOL>
However, the recipient states must repay that money to the banks, which means that EU assistance is causing these countries to run up debts with private banks.<EOL>
In May he returned with extremely important news, backed up by the interparliamentary delegation chaired by Mrs Erika Mann.<EOL>
They do need adequate information for this, however, and it must be formulated in an appropriate way.<EOL>
There is thus a need for stronger resolve and greater clarity in defining the commitments to be honoured by third countries in the field of women’s rights.<EOL>
I would ask the President-in-Office to undertake to look into this matter of the Scotch-Irish language and see to it that the principle of equality be implemented with regard to this language, along with all the other languages of the European Union, so that they can all stand on a level playing field.<EOL>
It is reasonable that this directive needs to be updated as a result of the accession of new Member States and the development of the single market and forest research.<EOL>
Quite often, it appears that whatever the problem, the answer seems to be from this place more EU and more regulation.<EOL>
Moreover, Russia must make a positive contribution in the case of 'frozen conflicts' and must now bring to an end the unlawful circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.<EOL>
My second comment concerns its ties to the various choices for regional integration and economic blocs.<EOL>
Consequently, I am stunned by his bold declaration that Turkey is not a European country.<EOL>
Europe makes no difference in supporting the peace processes in these countries properly and effectively.<EOL>
In particular, I should like to draw the attention of those Members who are calling for a strong stance on the opt-out issue to this point.<EOL>
In my view that is the biggest obstacle to accession to the European Union.<EOL>
We are, however, only carrying out research programmes with civil objectives.<EOL>
All this therefore leads the Union to take a careful and concerned look at the development of this situation and these policies.<EOL>
I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed.<EOL>
We must condemn the ongoing torture, mistreatment and persecution faced by human rights’ activists and organisations.<EOL>
One should preferably let culture get on by itself, and one should not try to possess it for oneself.<EOL>
I fully understood the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, considering de facto support of the dairy sector as one of these new challenges financed by modulation.<EOL>
The authors of the petition declare their support for attempts to help Turkish Cypriots who, from a legal and social point of view, form an integral part of Cyprus.<EOL>
<EOL>
This will put and end to the anomalies of the aid system, in which costs increase as production decreases.<EOL>
These are very precise questions, which also fall within the remit of the Member States.<EOL>
It is the only city in the world where in an area of one square kilometre, you can see buildings belonging to five religions: there are mosques, a Roman Catholic cathedral, an Orthodox church, a synagogue and a Protestant church.<EOL>
The Commission believes that the lack of coordination in fiscal policies, the lack of coordination in Member States' charging, hinders the efficiency of transport operations and restricts the development of the single market and economic integration.<EOL>
<EOL>
The use of rain forests for a European station in Central America with consumers who come from Paris is not what we understand by autonomous regional development.<EOL>
This is not a problem just for Spain and Morocco, and nor must it be seen purely from the perspective of controlling illegal migration.<EOL>
Mr Bonde, the interpretation of the Presidency, which, as you know, is responsible for interpreting the Rules of Procedure (with the greatest of respect for the Legal Service, of course, but it is not the Legal Service that interprets the Rules of Procedure, but rather the Presidency) ...<EOL>
The recent attack against the UN headquarters in Iraq is a dramatic example of this.<EOL>
In Afghanistan, the 1963 Constitution as promulgated by King Zahir Shah is an exemplary document.<EOL>
In any case, the Union's effort alone is not enough to combat climate change.<EOL>
So what we are actually seeing here is the final stage of implementation of the CFP.<EOL>
It is absolutely essential that we enshrine in European law the right to join trade unions and the right to bargain collectively.<EOL>
The proposal for a Directive on the taxation of energy products has returned before this House and I must again congratulate Mr Cox on the further simplification and rationalisation which he has tried to achieve.<EOL>
We cannot transform the legitimate battle to protect the environment into a war between poor peoples.<EOL>
That is very clear.<EOL>
We welcome the fact that the Commission's initiative has taken the form of a non-binding communication.<EOL>
I have noted your suggestion of 2012, Mrs Bowles, and I will bear it in mind.<EOL>
Union enlargement is one of the key issues for the Finnish Presidency.<EOL>
I say that I welcome possible military action by NATO because I realise that a political solution, however desirable it may be, is becoming increasingly unlikely.<EOL>
Mrs Fraisse is absent, probably due to transport problems, which we are all suffering today.<EOL>
We pretend that we are all agreed on this, but this is not so in practice.<EOL>
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.<EOL>
Written Declaration number 0071/2009, submitted by Members Elizabeth Lynne, Michail Tremopoulos, Lívia Járóka and Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, on the fight against breast cancer in the European Union, has been signed by over half of Parliament's Members.<EOL>
We must ensure that we bring about less and better regulatory reforms.<EOL>
Yet this is not enough, as these farmers have suffered huge losses, with many on the brink of bankruptcy, which has undermined the authority of the European Union, and of us MEPs.<EOL>
We want to try to make this more comfortable and more interactive, so please feel free to come right to the front and then we can look the Commissioner right in the eye.<EOL>
In this context, the following steps could be envisaged.<EOL>
My colleague Mr Michel has participated in all the Assemblies held since he took office.<EOL>
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.<EOL>
It is therefore logical - and I fully agree with this - for our finally to have a Community agreement between the European Union and the United States, so that, competing as a European continent, we can use the opportunities that the USA has already been using for years in our Member States.<EOL>
We are now definitively rooted in the Lisbon Treaty as regards the budgetary procedure.<EOL>
The Committee of the Regions ought to be consulted in view of the importance of the powers exercised by bodies with local and regional power in their capacity as public authorities.<EOL>
In addition, I am of the opinion that the proven methods that various Member States have used in the past in connection with public transport should be taken into consideration in this context: it must be possible to retain the licensing procedure that has been found to be so good and cost-effective in Finland.<EOL>
We therefore reject it.<EOL>
We consider it important that the Parliament be informed how the research fund is being used: that means having not only the figures but also an analytical presentation of the results of this fund.<EOL>
(PL) I am voting in favour of Mr Virrankoski's report on the annual strategic priorities of the Commission regarding the budget procedure for 2008.<EOL>
I think that is a very important point.<EOL>
I welcome the fact that the EIB has a fund of EUR 31 billion for small and medium-sized industries, and I think that more should be done in this area.<EOL>
This is the first time I have done such a thing.<EOL>
Commissioner, I believe that as long as we do not have consistent labelling, we will never be free of disputes about BSE in this House and in Europe in general.<EOL>
I hope that people beyond this House will extrapolate from what has just happened.<EOL>
Once again, we have here a list of wishes which we know from experience and having dealt with three Turkish governments will not be satisfied in a hurry, however desirable that may be.<EOL>
Skills must be the key criterion, not gender.<EOL>
This directive should be tied to the provisions on assessing and avoiding the risk of drought, which also causes great economic and environmental damage.<EOL>
Secondly, because the programme has been monitored, we now have concrete evidence that successes have undoubtedly been achieved through our environmental measures in cutting back on the quantities of nutrients introduced into the soil and in protecting the natural world.<EOL>
If these proposals fail to be effective, I for one shall campaign for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the CFP entirely.<EOL>
Turkey will be absent from the Conference even though this method was largely conceived with it in mind. This is a Turkey whose "European vocation' we want to recognize, that is, depending on your point of view, the country's vocation to become a member of the European Union or not.<EOL>
That is not necessary, firstly because we have a witness, Mr Bush himself, who said: yes, there are renditions, yes, there are black sites.<EOL>
We have just been listening to the British Foreign Minister.<EOL>
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.<EOL>
Välkommen till Europaparlamentet!<EOL>
This is a very important issue.<EOL>
One Member State, Austria, has been polluting the River Raba for the past seven years, as Mr Hegyi mentioned earlier.<EOL>
Neither can we forget the victims of these disasters, who need immediate aid and support.<EOL>
The vote will take place at 12 noon today.<EOL>
However, I would like it noted that we do not agree in full with the wording of paragraph 125 of the report.<EOL>
I believe that it does and that the sooner it takes action on this matter, the better!<EOL>
   – I should first like to commend Mr Nassauer on his excellent report, which received the backing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.<EOL>
And, secondly, the profit motive and the profit and loss account of the company, legitimate though those concepts may be, are not the supreme interest, but they must coexist with an extraordinary degree of transparency, fairness and commercial security for the customer.<EOL>
This is absolutely not a meaningless question.<EOL>
I would ask the Members and other groups to support this proposal.<EOL>
It would be constitutionally indelicate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland.<EOL>
the failure to properly tackle unemployment, by persisting in channelling huge sums to support the financial sector, without paying the same attention to the productive sectors.<EOL>
But firstly, they are managed bureaucratically and secondly, no account is taken of the fact that these shipyards do in fact also continue to invest during the general process of rationalisation.<EOL>
Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases, I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice.<EOL>
It evidently very much depends on who is asking, what is being asked, and when.<EOL>
It is still too early to fix a date for accession.<EOL>
Thank you, Mr Wynn.<EOL>
The Commission’s proposal is a consistent implementation of this idea.<EOL>
In the light of the serious and dangerous challenge represented by racist and homophobic violence, decisive leadership is needed from those in positions of political power – especially from the Presidency of the Council.<EOL>
In the Committee on Budgetary Control, I pointed out at a very early stage that there were incompatibilities here.<EOL>
I would like you to voice your thoughts on this matter to us.<EOL>
The European Union cannot operate effectively unless there is cooperation and understanding between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.<EOL>
I feel that we must be constructive in learning from this morning' s events.<EOL>
When preparing motions for a resolution, the wealth of natural resources in this country should not be the only influencing factor.<EOL>
That is why it is also in the interest of the United States to draw negotiations to a close quickly and ensure that the visa requirement for Union citizens is consigned to history.<EOL>
Zbigniew Zaleski, I agree that trade must not amount to a kind of neocolonial theft of raw materials from developing countries.<EOL>
For the first time it covers 25 Member States.<EOL>
For the southern part of Europe, that is a big opportunity and in the sun belt of the world there is also a big industrial opportunity for our industries.<EOL>
The aim must be for the forms of financial assistance from the European Union to be transparent and properly justified.<EOL>
Moreover, EU funds, as we know, are mainly managed by the national authorities.<EOL>
If Mr Bill Clinton sees fit to adopt a moralizing tone towards Europeans and accuse them of mismanagement or failure to understand modern society, as he did at the G8 summit, that's his problem.<EOL>
The wording of Amendment No 45 is actually better than EMAC 9 - the amendment which was adopted in the Environment Committee - because it sets out a form of words where the natural economic interest of both the buyer and the seller must coincide if the hierarchy of remedies must mean repair rather than replacement.<EOL>
I cannot understand why something that is extremely harmful to youngsters should be good - or at least harmless - to adults.<EOL>
Ever since export subsidies for the transportation of live animals were introduced in 1989, this House has on many occasions voted in favour of their removal from the EU budget.<EOL>
It is likely that Austria's good reputation as a competitive Member State driving responsible policies under the leadership of its present government helped in making the choice.<EOL>
   Mr President, all the Council’s fine words, as enshrined in the Tampere programme and confirmed in the Hague programme, have borne very little fruit to date.<EOL>
I feel members should be aware that we have today, in this House, received a blackmailing letter in which we are threatened with terrorist attacks and letter bombs.<EOL>
It would be the basis for both our political security and economic stability.<EOL>
The main aim of the Commission's proposals is to tighten up the regulations of the Stability and Growth Pact.<EOL>
I know that the Commission is very much wrestling with the problem of defining areas.<EOL>
The EU needs a proper and predictable system for financing its own budget in order to end the perpetual, damaging squabbling over national contributions to the EU budget.<EOL>
In the interests of China we shall raise the question of human rights, and enlightened representatives of the Chinese political system would do well to listen to us and to this resolution, which is in China's interests and which would help China to advance, something it cannot do unless it respects human rights.<EOL>
In the intervening period, which is set to last for some time, they need support for democracy, education, the environment and the economy.<EOL>
The EIB achieved some positive results in 2009, when its activity increased by 40%, its funding for small and medium-sized enterprises increased by 55%, its funding for less-developed regions increased by 36%, and its funding aimed at combating climate change and promoting energy efficiency increased by 73%<EOL>
According to the press, the repressive occupation claimed 200 000 victims, a third of the population.<EOL>
These amendments try to improve the action against fraud and she has pointed to the most important one, the question of how to relate collection costs to performance criteria.<EOL>
Some countries, such as Greece, Italy and Portugal, currently fail even to record racial attacks.<EOL>
Mr President, Mr Carnero González, on the first question, it is quite clear that of course the Austrian Presidency is not the only one to discuss this important issue and, as I said, things do not always have to be done in public.<EOL>
I have every confidence that the Commissioner will be the guardian of a Europe of equal opportunities within the Commission.<EOL>
To summarise: What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid?<EOL>
I would like to stress that our position is essentially based on full support for the values of reconciliation and of overcoming a past tragedy, which were the values that inspired the transition to democracy and which led to the 1978 Constitution.<EOL>
The Christian trade unions are still waiting in the wings, as are many representatives of small sectors and areas of employment.<EOL>
In Framework 8 is it possible to no longer resort to this system of advanced submission of projects?<EOL>
It will be clear to the rapporteur that I still do not like his report.<EOL>
And we must also bear in mind that there are other sources of information which already include data of this kind.<EOL>
I have always been an advocate of regulations, and I hope that the Commission will produce more proposals for regulations in future.<EOL>
The European Parliament should therefore not 'recommend' that tax 'burdens' should be reduced, as is the case in paragraph 41.<EOL>
The report addresses important issues and I therefore voted in favour of it.<EOL>
This is thanks to cross-party cooperation, between the groups within the European Parliament. I would especially like to thank Mrs Lienemann, but also Chris Davies from the liberal group and Mrs Schleicher from the Christian-Democrats.<EOL>
Winter starts on 1 November.<EOL>
The debate on deficiencies in the current chemicals policy has been going on for quite some time.<EOL>
I was obviously here and I do not know whether the machine worked.<EOL>
They then tried to accuse the then Minister of Agriculture of a supposed fraud in the award of subsidies, but responsibility for the control and payment of CAP subsidies falls to the regional governments, in accordance with the distribution of competences of the Spanish State.<EOL>
Decisions need to be taken at European level in order to promote real economic recovery and a real increase in the level of employment.<EOL>
I believe that we can now pursue the implementation of all future maritime initiatives with renewed vigour and confidence.<EOL>
   Madam President, it seems as if Commissioner Wallström and quite a number of those who have taken part in the debate in this House are of the view that the press in the European Union and perhaps also radio and television have a strong bias against the draft Constitution.<EOL>
Hence our rejection.<EOL>
   . – The unanimous approval that this report received in committee illustrates the growing importance that all groups in Parliament, right and left alike, have been attributing to relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) parliaments and their members.<EOL>
I know that some will always argue that stability and democracy are somehow incompatible in Pakistan.<EOL>
This strategy in favour of employment not only is not in contradiction with the logic of Monetary Union but, on the contrary, is precisely in the framework of the single currency where we shall achieve the vital level of autonomy to develop a European policy to boost growth and create jobs.<EOL>
However - and the developing countries are right in this respect - we must demonstrate that it is possible to organise economic growth and prosperity without doing so at the expense of the environment.<EOL>
The limited increases in efficiency in the sector are too small to compensate for the new levies.<EOL>
It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection, for example, with tax issues and cyber crime.<EOL>
Mr President, the Commission welcomes this report by Parliament.<EOL>
Proper migration management is beneficial to the European Union Member States' societies and economies.<EOL>
How can a young person develop physically, intellectually and spiritually without access to the necessary nutrition?<EOL>
I would, however, like to sound a note of caution.<EOL>
The international community must be prepared to make sure that its humanitarian aid reaches those hundreds of thousands of people instead of being used as a pawn in a political power game.<EOL>
   . – Mr President, I can be brief.<EOL>
We must take the reality of women, young people, sex workers and drug users seriously, and that reality is what we need to take as a basis.<EOL>
But there is also the mid-term budget review, and it seems to me we have almost forgotten about that.<EOL>
This success is the result of political will and a common vision of the future.<EOL>
My understanding is that those animals are normally taken out of the food chain.<EOL>
This election was closely fought, but it was a democratic one and, for us, that is the news of the day.<EOL>
We have fallen short in the immigration challenge.<EOL>
While I welcome the work of our colleague Mr De Clercq on a subject which I hold very dear, I would also like to specify the weaknesses, as I see them, in this report.<EOL>
At the same time, the Union has widened: our membership has more than doubled from 12 to 25.<EOL>
In 50 years our worlds may be ready to meet, but no earlier.<EOL>
One example of this is the large number of immigrants reaching the coast of eastern Spain, or more than 4 000 immigrants from Sri Lanka and Pakistan waiting to be taken to Europe from the beaches of Guinea Conakry.<EOL>
Mr Zalm, the President of the ECOFIN Council, compared the stability pact to an atom bomb which is there as a deterrent rather than to be used.<EOL>
A significant number of them are also systemically important groups.<EOL>
You should all be proud of what together we have achieved - the greatest and biggest single market in the world, now bringing opportunities to 500 million people, and the most successful endeavour in economic cooperation anywhere in the world.<EOL>
I hope these will be confirmed over the coming days, and I will discuss this with Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.<EOL>
They want to take part in a real public debate.<EOL>
in writing. - I voted for this report which addresses the current shortcomings of the internal market.<EOL>
(Parliament adopted the resolution)<EOL>
Mr President, the fisheries agreements the EU has signed with third countries have always formed a decisive part of its common fisheries policy.<EOL>
So, all in all, we can be satisfied with the progress that has been made, even if the drafting on the points I made earlier could have been a little better.<EOL>
It offers the 'discerning sportsman' the ultimate hunting experience: large buffalo, lion, water buck, very rare East African sitatunga, leopards, antelopes, etc.<EOL>
As Mr Elles stated in his speech just now, a good EUR 15 billion in budget commitments remained unspent last year, which is an inconceivably huge amount of money.<EOL>
I understand that Parliament has striven for a wording which guarantees the personal integrity of all the parties involved.<EOL>
We are therefore voting in favour of the report.<EOL>
I am not talking here about the common cold, but about such conditions as cancer, Parkinson's disease, AIDS, and other dreadful scourges.<EOL>
With regard to closed areas, for which no reliable data are actually available, the experts advised that these areas should be redefined and made smaller, since closing zones whose exploitation is feasible would lead in practice to more illegal fishing with greater impunity, given the lack of fishing interest among the parties, which would also exacerbate the scarcity of data with which to assess stocks.<EOL>
The effectiveness of such measures is, of course, dependent on rigorous controls in the ports of landing, constant monitoring and recording of the composition of the catch and prompt closure of the fishery when the by-catch limit is reached.<EOL>
All parliamentary reports published in all those years clearly state Parliament's priorities where crucial reforms are concerned.<EOL>
Today I believe that we politicians cannot generalise when answering questions like that.<EOL>
Right at the start, I would like to say quite clearly that violence against women has no place in a civilised society.<EOL>
I would also be the first to admit that the quality of this comprehensive legislative package has been enhanced by its passage through Parliament, and I am pleased that this is the case.<EOL>
On another note, I would have preferred the term 'plant protection products', as originally used in the regulation, to have been retained.<EOL>
Linguistic diversity is part of Europe's cultural legacy and a unique treasure that we all have a responsibility to protect.<EOL>
I have therefore abstained from voting in the final vote on the Aparicio Sánchez report.<EOL>
   Mr President, my Group voted against this report because we feel that this issue has been pushed and promoted by the arms industry.<EOL>
However, that is the way forward.<EOL>
I therefore do not believe we should return to this issue during the current budgetary debate.<EOL>
As rapporteur, I have attempted to cooperate on equal terms with all the political groups within the committee, and our collaboration has resulted in many balanced compromises.<EOL>
Progress over the past five years has been too slight.<EOL>
By means of their opinions they have acquired an undeniable authority, technical and moral.<EOL>
I would like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on their reports and on the consensuses that they have achieved under particularly difficult conditions.<EOL>
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)<EOL>
At present there is no opportunity for voting against the Commission’s proposal. That is why we choose to vote in favour of the European Parliament’s proposal, which contains fewer regulations than both the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s position.<EOL>
In accordance with the institutional rules for their participation, the Members can attend plenary meetings, and the Commission will regularly provide information on those negotiations which are not open to observers on a regular basis to all Members of the European Parliament present at COP6.<EOL>
The adoption, ratification and implementation of the ILO convention can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor and improve the position of the large number of women on the labour market.<EOL>
As a member of the farming community, I really cannot endorse the discussion about price reductions.<EOL>
It is also clear, however, that, right now, we must not deviate from the objective of achieving tangible situations and establishing practical prospects that are closely linked to reality.<EOL>
The improved coordination between these separate instruments produced by our committee has doubtless made our proposals more effective and will certainly provide Europe's citizens with a better service.<EOL>
   Globalisation offers a number of opportunities, especially for reducing poverty.<EOL>
The only way of tackling the health issue is to pursue the approach launched some time ago by the European Union. This involves developing methods of cultivation and introducing less harmful varieties whilst also boosting information campaigns designed to reduce consumption.<EOL>
I congratulate the rapporteur.<EOL>
The programme of economic reforms has received additional support through Community macrofinancial packages, which have been awarded on the basis of compliance with agreed conditions on economic and structural policy.<EOL>
Amendments Nos 3 and 32 on the granting of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine-growing areas and extending the deadline for submitting applications for premiums for the 1999/2000 marketing year from 31 December 1999 to 31 March 2000 do not cause any difficulties.<EOL>
The EU's financial potential should be exploited to this end, and particular emphasis should be placed on linking gender issues to plans for exiting the economic crisis and effectively implementing the Europe 2020 strategy.<EOL>
We do not support separatism or independence in Kosovo but we insist that Belgrade grants real autonomy.<EOL>
Finally, I would like to emphasise, once again, what many of you have said, which is that we must think beyond the motor industry when we discuss the current crisis.<EOL>
Second, we aim to have a comprehensive approach to disaster prevention at EU level.<EOL>
Is it not possible to get the message through to the public for once that it was not exactly like that?<EOL>
As far as the European Works Council is concerned, the Commission believes that in order to improve the legal framework of the European Works Council action at Community level is required.<EOL>
In this brief explanation of vote, however, what I wish to highlight is that it was our colleague, Franz Turchi, from the UEN Group, who had already tabled a proposal to this effect two years ago, which was regrettably not given a favourable response.<EOL>
National training qualifications must be comparable, although this does not mean that they have to be standardised.<EOL>
Such a way of producing sugar cannot be the yardstick against which European sugar production is to be compared.<EOL>
This aspect may not have been sufficiently highlighted in our proposal.<EOL>
The only virtue of this resolution, which is supported by all political groups except mine, is to deplore this state of affairs and boast about energy efficiency that it undermines elsewhere by promoting unbridled exports.<EOL>
Harmonisation does not mean bland similarity.<EOL>
So these connections are very clear, and my advice would be: use all possible instruments to strengthen capacity at home; use - in smart ways - structural and cohesion funds, where they have committed the amount of framework programme actually for the purpose of that - EUR 50 billion is committed - and use that money so that in the future they would help themselves at home and they would help themselves also in the possibility to compete globally, because the world is global.<EOL>
The situation is demonstrably clear.<EOL>
We can go even further and say that innovation constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humankind today.<EOL>
However, if we should now experience problems in Sweden, will we then have a balance of payments problem?<EOL>
All too often, the labour market is comparable to a centrifuge, in which far too many people end up on the periphery.<EOL>
Nevertheless, the situation in the north of the region is still very worrying and may deteriorate when the rainy season arrives. That may hamper the delivery of humanitarian aid, as has happened in the past.<EOL>
A potential market of hundreds of billions of euros.<EOL>
I am in agreement with the conclusions that have been made by the rapporteur and have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report.<EOL>
An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities, and not the individual' s gender, which decide how much he or she is paid.<EOL>
For the good of all, it is to be hoped that she, Baroness Ashton, realises how important her role is, that she defends it, and that she is determined to assert this role when giving substance to the requirements of the treaty, for example in strengthening the European Union's relationships with its strategic partners, and in consolidating its own leadership in multilateral forums.<EOL>
The third aspect is that of exports.<EOL>
It will also ensure legal certainty for all enterprises and the uniform application of competition policy, and will simplify procedures in line with the one-stop-shop principle.<EOL>
As regards the Structural Funds, European regional policy has become a real handicap for France, contrary to the myth complacently propounded by some, including, alas, the current Commissioner responsible for regional policy.<EOL>
REACH should be a matter of common sense.<EOL>
There are others like Florence Aubenas, but they do not belong to great Western media organisations and they do not come from the West.<EOL>
We are hoping that this will provide further support for the peace process and open additional lines of communication and dialogue.<EOL>
I would come at it slightly differently, and I would like ask you through the chair, Commissioner: should not all legislation in this area, as a matter of principle, be technology-neutral?<EOL>
There did not seem to be any dissent in by the Conference of Presidents at the time and it was hardly questioned.<EOL>
This system will allow consumers to take informed decisions; it will reduce the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking.<EOL>
It is an opinion that shows some complementarity with the perspectives highlighted by the Commission when it refers to climate change, etc.<EOL>
But this never actually happened.<EOL>
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for her excellent report, especially because in order to draw up this kind of report on this particular issue it is not enough to be a sensitive politician: one must be a very committed technocrat.<EOL>
Inshore fishing essentially takes place in waters that come under exclusive national jurisdiction, and yet inshore fishermen, in many instances, are subjected to common fisheries policy regulations while reaping few of the benefits.<EOL>
That is a figure that, I believe, is broadly satisfactory.<EOL>
Yet this did not stop him from defending his rights which, after all, are enshrined in the Pakistani constitution.<EOL>
There is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate.<EOL>
As many of you have pointed out, it is more important than ever for Georgia to strengthen its democracy and hold free and fair elections, and we will see what happens on 21 May.<EOL>
We believe such interference undermines minority rights, thereby contravening standards of governance to which Belarus has signed up as part of its commitments to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe.<EOL>
Although the smart car system will cost EUR 4 billion it will ultimately save EUR 26 billion across Europe in accident and congestion costs.<EOL>
Finally, it must at long last be ensured that governments do not have a monopoly on negotiating and implementing WTO agreements, but that a democratically elected assembly is set up.<EOL>
I know that my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, is concerned about the way that self- and co-regulation develops, but I would argue that, if we consider that as a genuine alternative at the beginning of the process and see how it is integrated and that safeguards are built in and check it against the alternative of heavyweight and intrusive legislation, this can only be to the benefit of simplifying and improving the regulatory climate.<EOL>
<EOL>
The Vice-President of the European Commission said in Ljubljana that the start of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Council was the end of the division between the old and new members of the European Union.<EOL>
What is not legitimate is to play off one European institution against another.<EOL>
Moreover, it will be possible to achieve better results by adopting the additional measures and structural changes agreed within the European Union.<EOL>
I wish someone from the Council had been here this morning: we needed them to be here.<EOL>
Fernández Martín report (A5-0216/2000)<EOL>
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the press in Europe is under no obligation to take a balanced approach.<EOL>
The question arises: should we not in future bring in a European integration week highlighting good examples, and will integration not also require financial assistance from the European Union, which could be used to support particularly promising joint research ventures?<EOL>
A crisis is also an opportunity.<EOL>
In the conclusions of the Commission communication, it is claimed that while the Commission 'is carrying out a radical reform of its working methods at the political, financial and administrative levels... in the meantime there are growing fears that Europe may lose touch with the immediate concerns of its citizens' .<EOL>
Similarly, I want to say as of now that I could not in fact, under different circumstances, disagree with the substance of the proposals made.<EOL>
Opening up the energy sector to competition is indeed vehemently opposed by the unions, which reject the idea that the right to energy should be regulated by the dictates of money.<EOL>
Then the workforce can confidently move from one country to another, businesses can trust contracts, and consumers can be sure that the cost of a product or service is the right one and has been transparently determined.<EOL>
Thus the emerging economies also need to accept, to a certain extent, the principle of reciprocity in concessions in line with their level of development and their competitiveness in a given sector.<EOL>
For this reason, let me repeat that free trade is what both the developing and the developed countries need most and what will enable us to progress.<EOL>
It is clear that the obvious deficiencies in European agricultural policy cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely without a reform.<EOL>
Those are the various points I wanted to make to Mr Pafilis who, quite rightly, questioned me on the safety of air transport.<EOL>
Furthermore, it is necessary to intensify efforts to combat international organised crime networks and to increase police and judicial cooperation with competent EU agencies.<EOL>
Anyone who examined what is now the European Union' s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk.<EOL>
<EOL>
We all support both the Portuguese with the fires which have affected them and the central Europeans with their floods.<EOL>
I do wonder about something, however: studying the names that are circulating - for example, Jan Peter Balkenende, David Miliband and Herman Van Rompuy, to name but three - can it be possible that no one has noticed that all three regularly attend meetings of both the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission?<EOL>
This issue is too extensive to address in just two minutes, and since no one else will wish to make a long speech on this subject, I think that I should be allowed to overrun my speaking time.<EOL>
The former works outside the EU, the latter inside the EU, and they have different objectives.<EOL>
Lastly, I ask the Commissioner to concur that although Aung San Suu Kyi – whose house arrest is unreasonable – is a crucial player in the Burma affair, we must accept that many others are also languishing in prison, including many members of the Burmese parliament.<EOL>
However, this gentleman must not become a stumbling block to a new chapter in European-African relations.<EOL>
This is precisely what we are interested in; that this is known as universal services or services of general interest, and that this service will in any case ultimately apply to all citizens and will be a tool that is strengthened for the good of all.<EOL>
The European budget absolutely must continue to help those fighting the scourges afflicting European society.<EOL>
We also know that this external pressure adds to the internal pressure felt by States that are facing a decline in their own population, caused both by a slowdown of population growth and a reduction in the population of working age, with an increasing population of those over the age of 65. Concern is also growing about the sustainability of social security systems.<EOL>
It is as simple as that, and so it is a matter not just of industrial policy or veterinary policy, it is a matter of public health.<EOL>
In this regard, the difficulties in payments anticipated for 2003 should be resolved satisfactorily.<EOL>
As the IAEA Director General said - and I cannot draw a different conclusion - this situation is a source of grave concern for the EU and the international community.<EOL>
We are still far from the finishing line, however, and we now have an opportunity to speed up the process.<EOL>
The expansion of the Schengen Information System increases the window for corruption and creates a much larger collection of information for criminals wishing to hack into the network.<EOL>
First of all, we must focus on cooperation within the European Union, because I believe that if we succeed in this, if we make it clear – as I have tried to make it clear to you – that among the twenty-five of us, we can organise cooperation more effectively in a different way, namely by stepping up our efforts to pool information, by adapting our legislation, by cutting off funding for terrorism, then I think we can also create a precedent in that way, one which we can use in our contacts with the rest of the world.<EOL>
Nevertheless, the EU’s broad policy guidelines are being implemented without and sometimes in opposition to the will of the people, particularly of young people.<EOL>
Moreover, the fact that the average interpreting cost in the EP is higher than that in the Council or the Commission is also attributable to our forced monthly move to Strasbourg, where local resources are limited, so that Parliament’s interpreting costs in Strasbourg rise by 13%.<EOL>
Mr President, we in the Commission are used to having the more difficult questions to solve!<EOL>
In Europe, only the northern countries are meeting this commitment.<EOL>
Mr President, I do not really share your enthusiasm about Frontex.<EOL>
Because it was political and not economic reasons which led to the San José dialogue; because it was political and not economic reasons which are behind the consolidation of the Rio Group dialogue, and because it is political and not economic reasons which must lay down the guidelines for political transition to democracy in Cuba, with full respect for fundamental rights and liberties, as requested by this Parliament.<EOL>
It appears that this has helped us to understand better the dangers that we face.<EOL>
Furthermore, the effort to wipe the anti-Fascist victory from people's memories and to abolish its anniversary on 9 May is revelatory.<EOL>
(No proposed amendments submitted) .<EOL>
Both Mr Leinen and I were among the speakers.<EOL>
Such a system would create enormous practical difficulties for a very limited added value, which would go against the shared objective of simplification, and I therefore cannot accept it.<EOL>
I believe that the horizontal integration of the gender dimension into the different policies, the action programmes - preferably measures to reconcile work and family life - the efforts of the social agents themselves, training and information, measures to stimulate the participation of women, positive actions and action programmes, are ways to achieve equality and this, in turn, is a means, an instrument, for building a better, fairer and more caring society through social dialogue.<EOL>
The resolution does not reflect the whole Beijing Platform for Action.<EOL>
This is also apparent in other areas, such as competition etc.<EOL>
Madam President, what is the future of the euro in the light of the problems in Greece and, for that matter, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland?<EOL>
(DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, there are no new issues in the sphere of budgetary control.<EOL>
Slovakia's small and medium-sized enterprises consequently have no access to the significant financial support available for the effective development of new products, techniques and services.<EOL>
Tell us for once and for all, and tell the Presidency.<EOL>
I should also like to say that I fully support the rapporteur's call for us to keep to the rate of withholding tax proposed by the Commission, namely 20 %.<EOL>
Based on a one-sided industry-oriented approach he calls on us to support the biotechnology industry.<EOL>
I think it should be put to the vote before Amendment No 14.<EOL>
Fortunately, the situation in the labour market is now changing.<EOL>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for her excellent report.<EOL>
This year, in which you will be assessing this programme - if you have not already done so, because it was due to be assessed any time now - is the Commission going to do the same?<EOL>
Thirdly, there is a need to clarify the principles relating to funding and organisation.<EOL>
There are two new challenges.<EOL>
The European Union must intervene and urge the Moroccan Government to avoid further bloodshed and release those Sahrawi who have been detained illegally.<EOL>
It is because at the present time the morning-after pill is authorised in France and is distributed exclusively in schools. It cannot be authorised in hospitals.<EOL>
A much more profound change is needed in the longer term: a complete overhaul of the energy systems that have delivered our current prosperity and wealth.<EOL>
New employers in particular are sometimes prone to focus more on net profit, rather than spending on various safety equipment or creating work conditions; as a result, the health and occasionally the lives of employees may be jeopardised.<EOL>
As European Socialists, we remain convinced that the people of East Timor will overcome this crisis associated with the difficulties of a growing democracy, just as it has overcome previous, more serious crises that have threatened their very existence.<EOL>
Where Article 18 is concerned, we think it important that the suitability test be reserved for services where advice is given and not, for example, Internet-based dealing in securities.<EOL>
I must admit that I am no expert in this area of responsibility.<EOL>
In my judgment it is not a question of our seeking to take new powers, it is a question of our seeking to exercise the powers that we have already been given by the Treaty.<EOL>
(LT) I would like to thank all participants in the debate for today's discussions.<EOL>
The clear message given is that the Rhine Commission has good legislation.<EOL>
Would the Commission consider doing anything in partnership with Member States to try and tackle the areas with highest unemployment?<EOL>
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.<EOL>
We highlight weak points in order that they may be rectified and also avoided in the forthcoming budget.<EOL>
I looked at the lorry he was sitting on and I thought: that is another one we do not have' .<EOL>
I say again, this budget is evidence of a call from Mr Duff and his colleagues for more Europe, not smarter Europe.<EOL>
You spoke very wisely.<EOL>
The version of the Solidarity Fund adopted by the European Parliament in 2006 is a strong and flexible instrument which serves the interests of the EU, and its deployment will enable those living in eligible areas to benefit from effective assistance and support based on solidarity.<EOL>
Mr van den Broek will keep you closely informed of the development of the situation in the area, as Mr Truscott also requested this morning.<EOL>
The amendments that I tabled, which were incorporated into the rapporteur's text, aim to improve the efficiency of the management of funds contributed by the Union and to achieve greater transparency and, all in all, better use of the available resources.<EOL>
This is true also of foreign and security policy, where Europe still has much to do over the coming years.<EOL>
What would be the core competences of the European public prosecutor?<EOL>
I believe that, with 10% of its population of Turkish origin, Bulgaria is particularly sensitive to this major event.<EOL>
I would like to refer to one of these amendments which I believe to be very important for Parliament and for the other European institutions.<EOL>
If human safety, instead of military security, had been the main priority, we should probably not have been forced to see so much death and destruction as we have now.<EOL>
• the joint arrangements for setting up governments submissive to imperialism,<EOL>
But the crucial point of our resolutions, which have a common thread, is that we now have the opportunity, we believe, for fresh negotiations about the future of the Tibetan people, with a possible move towards selfgovernment.<EOL>
This effectively implies a new division of tasks that is likely to give fresh impetus to the Union.<EOL>
As I said in my previous answer, in this area, in this question, with these problems, we are now dealing with some investigations but I cannot publicly confess because by nature, I have to be discreet.<EOL>
(Sustained applause)<EOL>
We need to oversee the viability of our social security and pension systems, which are one of the characteristic features of the European solidarity model.<EOL>
They need to understand the difference between winter flu – which is not what this debate is about – and avian flu – which is not what this debate is about, even though 67 people have died from it, all working or living with birds and poultry in Asia.<EOL>
The aim of the present revision must therefore be to make the eco-audit scheme more attractive.<EOL>
I am not only thinking of the crisis, but also of all those well-known challenges that we identified years ago as important challenges for European development.<EOL>
The problem is the other species in the Mediterranean.<EOL>
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).<EOL>
Twenty-seven of my counterparts received personal letters to make them aware that things are not going well.<EOL>
Errors seem to be at the level of implementing institutions, and therefore I ask that the European Parliament and Commission call for the individual Member States to provide a thorough audit for the funds received.<EOL>
3.<EOL>
The Commission has stressed the need to do everything possible to prevent the situation from deteriorating.<EOL>
Can you believe it?<EOL>
We need to be clear here.<EOL>
But we are right to bring in a coherent and proportionate set of rules to protect ourselves if necessary.<EOL>
President of the Commission. - We are now assessing the reasons why all the goals and targets were not attained.<EOL>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for dealing so thoroughly with such a difficult subject as the issue of the choice of law applicable to divorce and legal separation.<EOL>
The following changes have been proposed:<EOL>
I would like to welcome the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, who is on an official visit to the European Parliament.<EOL>
Whilst I have the floor, on a related matter, does the Commissioner have any idea when he expects to publish his proposal on a decision to accede to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which of course fits into this same category?<EOL>
It does not contribute positively to the common European policy.<EOL>
Thirdly, do you really think it fitting for the European Parliament to abandon its sittings under pressure of an announced demonstration and to bring its political activities to a halt?<EOL>
If the answer is yes, the present debate would itself be a surprising event.<EOL>
The budgetary funds and the Structural Funds are also in need of revision.<EOL>
This means in real terms that administrative reconstruction must start as early as in the run-up to enlargement.<EOL>
I truly believe that we still need the European Network and Information Security Agency.<EOL>
How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says, and I quote again: "It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity."<EOL>
Subject: Ban on visiting Cuban nationals imprisoned in the United States<EOL>
Moreover, the implementation of the Schengen agreement neither opposes nor obstructs the Nordic passport union.<EOL>
Sometimes we had the feeling that we were being subjected to what the French call 'un procès d'intention', a kind of 'Schuldvermutung.'<EOL>
From that point of view, I believe, in fact, that Mr Van den Berg is more than right in emphasising the role we are to play now.<EOL>
For example, if it is a question of the refusal to give Layla Zana and her colleagues a really fair new trial.<EOL>
First of all, the knowledge triangle, particularly innovation, and I understand that here it is essential to act quickly in order at least to launch the European Technological Institute.<EOL>
A high number of these totally unnecessary deaths are due to financial despair in rural areas.<EOL>
This leaves it wide open to abuse.<EOL>
How are you going to speed things up?<EOL>
Although in most Member States the difference between women and men, as regards poverty, is increasingly shrinking and the average difference is 2% as regards poverty and persistent poverty, I would like to draw attention to the reality in the new Member States.<EOL>
Mr President, it is my pleasure to be here tonight for the debate on Mrs in 't Veld’s report on the communication on state aid for innovation.<EOL>
Thus, the Basque Autonomous Communities possess real power.<EOL>
We could of course disregard the liberalisation of rail transport if it were not for the fact that - as has been pointed out several times - other transport sectors have been liberalised without regard for the social or environmental costs in recent years, with disastrous consequences.<EOL>
   Thank you, I am sure we shall follow that up.<EOL>
It must be clear that there can be no question of a dialogue with that country until such time as Iran is prepared to stop terrorist activities, change its attitude to the peace process and recognise Israel's right to existence.<EOL>
That does not even come close to Cecilia Malmström's number of engagements with Parliament, because she has been here 25 times to speak to you.<EOL>
The annual social reports must, of course, present a reliable picture of what has happened in this area, and that means that, in common with the financial accounts, they naturally must be subject to independent verification.<EOL>
On this basis, our relations will be strengthened.<EOL>
Madam President, when the House discussed the last fisheries agreement with Madagascar more than two years ago, the European Parliament heavily criticised both the content and the procedure because we had not been given any chance to have our say.<EOL>
Also in preparation is a law concerning the basis of the reorganization of the Ministry of Justice, and a constitutional budgetary law. These two advances - concerning the judiciary and the budget - will be fundamental in reforming public administration.<EOL>
I am convinced that the proposal by the Arab countries will not bring an end to this situation either.<EOL>
However, I still believe that the money that we will spend in the future on this system is justified.<EOL>
If you do not make the most of this opportunity, do not play the victim or dramatise the rejection of the Commission.<EOL>
What we want, and this remains the starting position of the Socialist Group, is to keep trying for a political solution, because we do not believe the situation can be resolved by military means alone and we think that military intervention must always be part of a political approach.<EOL>
I would like to draw attention to the fact that it is very important that once the movement of third-country nationals in the Schengen area has been simplified, security guarantees in the Member States are not infringed.<EOL>
Fourthly, aerial spraying will be prohibited, but Member States will retain the option to make exceptions in limited cases where aerial spraying is the only feasible solution.<EOL>
If European farmers want to grow tobacco it should be without public subsidy and the subsidies that exist should be phased out over a number of years with extra support to Objective 1 and Objective 5b areas during the transition.<EOL>
I am reiterating my initial and constantly repeated concern, including by means of proposals to alter the report's projects, which can be summarised as the need to ensure the geopolitical balance of the EEAS about to be inaugurated.<EOL>
On the other hand, certain GUE politicians are now entering this current debate and attacking the Bullmann report for focusing too much on deregulation and competition.<EOL>
Why am I saying this?<EOL>
Since the communications industry manages data transmission, it has de facto control over democratic discussion and the access to knowledge.<EOL>
I will just say that, in the current phase, we should avoid giving the impression that we want to lecture other countries about what they should do within their own jurisdictions.<EOL>
Our strategy was clear - more money for research.<EOL>
The Commission is currently processing new, additional aid programmes worth EUR 28.5 million, which will start being implemented in the coming weeks, for emergency aid and aid to uprooted people.<EOL>
And parliaments cannot make such compromises as we unfortunately must sometimes accept on the part of governments.<EOL>
In addition to this economic disruption, devastating floods hit parts of Bulgaria in 2005, with many deaths and thousands left homeless.<EOL>
There must be a balance, however, so that any new directive that is passed is not unnecessarily obstructive to farmers and agricultural business.<EOL>
They understand our need to air concerns when they arise and when they are brought to us.<EOL>
That system, which we might envy today, had four weaknesses, especially after electrification.<EOL>
Yet research comes before all technological innovation and, sadly, there is a lot of truth in the saying that the Europeans are good at making knowledge out of ECUs, but bad at making ECUs out of knowledge.<EOL>
We share responsibility, while yet being reliant on others; we both shape events and are affected by them.<EOL>
The agreement concluded on 26 October 2004 with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland, the Dublin agreement, provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol.<EOL>
Not only are we running against the clock, we are also running against logic, and if we insist on doing so, the consequences could be disastrous.<EOL>
These guarantees came to nothing. As a result of public pressure and the fear of a boycott of the Olympic Games, the Chinese Government began talks with the representatives of the Dalai Lama.<EOL>
The development of rail transport is also a step towards more environmentally sustainable transport systems.<EOL>
In the long term, this will also be of benefit to their own personnel policy.<EOL>
The Commission is grateful for the support the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given to the proposals.<EOL>
Once again, you recommend them to continue with their efforts in a wide variety of areas: agricultural administration, the monitoring of Community expenditure and the fight against crime, corruption and fraud.<EOL>
That is an initiative in connection with which the European Union could play an important role within the United Nations, whose difficulties and inertia we took note of when, last year, someone from a country like Libya, which is certainly not at the forefront of human rights, was elected as head of the Human Rights Commission.<EOL>
In giving help as humanitarians, we hope that we are giving an example as Europeans too.<EOL>
Commissioner Nielson, thank you so much for taking over from your colleague Mr Bolkestein.<EOL>
There are countless legislative regulations within the European Union; these affect a vast range of social relations.<EOL>
There is a general perception amongst this community that regulations are being arbitrarily handed down from Brussels without any input from the bottom up.<EOL>
We grilled them.<EOL>
They are, after all, real people, not zombies.<EOL>
Secondly, it is justified by the EU's own interest in contributing to the financial, social and political stability of our neighbourhood countries as a condition for their development and democratic consolidation, as this is also a prerequisite for our own political stability.<EOL>
As far as the amendments are concerned, the Commission's position is as follows: Amendments Nos 1 and 3 relate to various concerns regarding the provisions on the distribution of powers between the Community and the Member States and regarding the need for the agreement to be interpreted in accordance with the Convention of the Law of the Sea, but the Commission considers that these concerns have already been taken into account in the declarations annexed to the proposal or in the agreement itself.<EOL>
Mr Caudron, I shall ask the services immediately to make it easier for Members to enter the Chamber.<EOL>
At the same time, it is also incredibly important to understand that it is men' s behaviour and attitudes which must be changed.<EOL>
Perhaps the limits can be reviewed to some extent in the future.<EOL>
Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance.<EOL>
And we believe that, within this world order, the European Union should act with a common voice which will allow it to be seen as a commercial, economic and social power and also as a great defender of human rights, multiculturalism and the environment.<EOL>
Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes<EOL>
It seems to me that today you could pick and choose between different opinions, covering the whole range from zero up to more than we have suggested in our proposal.<EOL>
That is why it is important - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for this - that EU competition policy should now finally be extended to energy, transport and pharmaceuticals.<EOL>
I consider it only right to mention the contributions from the general report by Mrs Cederschiöld and the report by Mr Schulz and Mr Bontempi.<EOL>
Where the environment is concerned, it has been possible to accomplish major progress thanks to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the Water Framework Directive and the directive on waste reduction and recycling.By preparing a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration and stepping up the fight against crime at Community level, progress has been made in promoting freedom of movement and establishment within the EU.<EOL>
In this area too, we will have to come up with some new ideas.<EOL>
We must seize this opportunity and urge the USA at the coming summit to take real action and waive visa requirements for all EU citizens.<EOL>
During the break in the sitting it came to my attention that an Italian soldier was killed today in Afghanistan in the NATO-led mission there.<EOL>
I will try not to repeat what has already been said by my Spanish and Portuguese colleagues and will talk about something that is not contained in this report.<EOL>
